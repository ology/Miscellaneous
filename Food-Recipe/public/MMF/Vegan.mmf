  2. Place soaked beans into a pot with stock or broth and enough water to
  cover by 2 inches.  Add bay leaf and whole garlic cloves.  Heat to a boil,
  reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until beans are tender
  (about 45 minutes).  (The beans should be softer than al dente but not
  cooked to the point where they begin to disintegrate.)  Don't drain beans
  until fennel and tomato sauce is cooked.
  
  3. Meanwhile, cut stalks off fennel bulb.  Chop the feathery leaves and
  reserve.  Trim off root end of the bulbs; cut bulbs in half lengthwise and
  slice thinly.  There should be about 8 cups of fennel slices. Discard
  stalks or save for soup.  Heat 1/3 cup olive oil in a large heavy skillet;
  cook fennel over medium-low heat until wilted and translucent, about 10-12
  minutes.  Do this in batches if necessary.

  from beans; drain beans.  Add beans to the skillet, tossing gently to
  combine all the ingredients.  Add parsley and chopped fennel leaves. Season
  with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat, add lemon juice and remaining
  olive oil to taste.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

      Title: Briami - Greek Vegetable Casserole
 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish, Side dish, Casseroles, Greek
   Servings:  6
 
      1    Eggplant
      2 lb Zucchini
      4 md Potatoes
      2    Green peppers
      1    Red pepper
      2 md Onions
      1 c  Olive oil
      4 md Tomatoes
      2    Garlic cloves
      1 ts Sugar
           Salt & pepper; to taste
 
  (1)  Prepare the vegetables: Cut the eggplant, zucchini  and  potatoes
     in  bite sized chunks (do not peel the zucchini or the eggplant).
     Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers and slice  them  into
     strips. Peel and slice the onions. Dice the tomatoes.
  
  (2)  Saute' the vegetables except the tomatoes  in  the  olive  oil  in
     small  batches.  Saut' each batch for 2 or 3 minutes, then remove
     from the pan, trying to drain some of the oil so that enough  oil
     is  left  for the next batch. When you're done, most (if not all)
     of the oil should be gone from the pan.
  
  (3)  Place the saute'ed vegetables in a  baking  dish  and  toss  them
     briefly  so  that you won't get only one kind of vegetable in one
     place.
  
  (4)  Add the tomatoes into the pan and saut' for a couple of  minutes.
     Crush the garlic and add to the tomatoes. Add the sugar, salt and
     pepper to taste and simmer for another minute.
  
  (5)  Pour the tomato sauce on top of the vegetables and  bake  at  350
     deg. F or until the vegetables are tender.
  
  (6)  Serve with plenty of fresh bread and,  if  you  like,  some  feta
     cheese on the side.
  
  RATING
  Difficulty:  easy.   Time:  30-45  minutes  preparation,  1  hour baking.
  Precision: No need to measure.

  Reduce the heat further & gently boil, partially covered, for 20 to 25
  minutes.  Check that the water is not evaporating too quickly.  You may
  have to add more water.
  
  To finish cooking, raise the heat to fairly high & fry quickly, without
  stirring, to allow the crust to form & just begin to char.  Remove from
  the heat & let stand, covered for 5 minutes.  Stir in the crust & serve,
  remembering to remove the red chilies, you may not want to bite into them.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegan, Main dish
   Servings:  6
 
      2 tb Butter (or margarine or oil)
      1 lg Onion; peeled and chopped
      2    Celery stalks
           - finely chopped
      2 lb Chestnuts; peeled & cooked
           -=OR=-
      3 cn -Whole chestnuts (15 oz ea.)
           -soaked and cooked
      2 tb Chopped parsley
      2 tb Lemon juice
      1    Garlic clove; crushed
           Fresh breadcrumbs (Optional)
           -(should be whole wheat)
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Oil

--------------------------------FOR COATING--------------------------------
           Dried breadcrumbs
 
  Melt the butter (or substitute) and saute the onion and celery over
  moderate heat for 10 minutes until soft but not brown.  Transfer to a
  large bowl.  Drain the chestnuts and add to the bowl.  Mix these
  ingredients together well.
  
  Mash the chestnuts, onion and celery, then mix into the bowl the chopped
  parsley, lemon juice and garlic.
  
  The mixture should be soft but firm enough to form into a roll, so add a
  few whole-wheat breadcrumbs, if necessary, especially if you're using
  canned chestnuts.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 F.  Pour a little of the oil into a roasting pan
  and put into the oven to heat.
  
  Form the chestnut mixture into a roll about 8 inches long, pressing it
  together carefully, then coat it well with the dried breadcrumbs.  Put the
  chestnut roll into the roasting pan and carefully turn it so that it is
  coated with hot oil.
  
  Bake for 45 minutes, until it is crisp on the outside, spooning a little
  more of the oil over the roll from time to time during the cooking.  Serve
  the Chestnut Roast cut into slices.

      Title: Chunky Granola (With No Oil Added)
 Categories: Grains, Breakfast, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings:  1
 
      8 c  Rolled oats
      1 c  Nuts (more if desired,
           -- up to double this amount)
    1/2 c  Sunflower seeds
    1/2 c  Whole millet
           -OR- whole buckwheat groats
      3 c  Whole wheat flour (or more)
           -OR- part cornmeal,
           - rice flour,
           - or other whole-grain flour
      1 ts Salt (or more, as desired)
    1/2 c  Honey (or more,
           -- up to double this amount)
      1 c  -Hot water, or up to:
      2 c  -Hot water *
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  * Note: More water makes the granola chunkier, less makes it crumbly.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  In a large bowl or pot, combine oats, nuts, seeds,
  millet, flour, and salt.  Mix together honey, water, and vanilla, and stir
  into dry ingredients.  Spread on a lightly oiled baking sheet and squeeze
  mixture together to form small chunks, but don't crowd; the chunks need to
  bake clear through.  Roast until golden brown, about 10 to 20 minutes.
  (With the larger amount of water, reduce heat and bake longer.)  As it
  bakes the granola may need stirring to brown evenly.  Cool thoroughly
  before storing.
  
  Variations:  Replace part of the water with the freshly squeezed juice of
  2 oranges (and add the grated rinds if the oranges were not sprayed with
  pesticides), or use 2 teaspoons orange oil.
  
  For "gingerbread" granola, use half molasses (for half honey) and add 2
  teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ginger and 1/4 teaspoon cloves.
  
  For a nice change, substitute maple syrup for honey.

  Bring about 6 cups of water to the boil.  Blanch the snow peas in the
  water for 1 minute.  Remove them with a slotted spoon, place in a
  strainer, and refresh immediately under cold running water. Cut into
  thirds and set aside.
  
  In the same boiling water used for the snow peas, cook the pasta until
  tender but still chewy.  Drain well and reserve about 1/2 cup of the
  cooking water.
  
  In a serving bowl, immediately toss the hot pasta in the sesame oil to
  prevent it from clumping together.
  
  In a blender or food processor, combine the remaining ingredients,
  starting with 1-1/2 tablespoons tamari and 1/4 teaspoon Szechuan
  peppercorns, with just enough of the pasta cooking liquid to create a
  medium-thick sauce (the consistency should be like pancake batter).
  
  Toss the sauce and reserved snow peas with the pasta.  Taste and add more
  tamari and pepper if desired.
  
  Garnish with the cucumber and scallion, and sprinkle with sesame seasoning
  salt before serving.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

  Mix flours. Crumble tofu into blender.  Add boiled water and salt to tofu
  in blender (carefully) and blend until not quite smooth. (Just a few pulses
  please). Dont do this in too small blender or without lid like I did once.
  The goal is muffins, not 2nd degree burns. Add immediately to flour and mix
  well.  Spoon into muffin tins or cast iron stick trays and bake at 400
  degrees for about 1/2 hour until golden brown. She suggests you heat oven
  first and place oiled muffin tins in to heat up beforehand to get a
  "wonderful crust".
  
  Please note, I have to oil the tins because I don't use teflon products
  around by birds, but this might work also.....This is not sweet bread, I
  serve corn potato chowder with it.  The corn sticks are better!

    1/2 c  Urad dahl
      3    Dry red chillies
           Curry leaves (2-3 sprigs)
      2 tb Coconut (optional)
 
  You will be able to get mustard seeds, curry leaves and urad dahl in any
  local Indian store.
  
  Save about 2 tsp of urad dahl and soak the rest of the urad dahl in water
  for about an hour. After an hour, grind the urad dahl, green chillies and
  ginger to the consistency of pancake batter and keep aside.
  
  In a pan, heat the 2 tsp veg oil and add the mustard seeds, 2 tsp urad dahl
  (that was saved), the curry leaves and the red chillies (after cutting them
  into fine pieces). When the mustard seeds start spluttering and the urad
  dahl starts turning golden brown, add 3 1/2 cups of water and the urad dahl
  batter, mix well and close the pan. When the water starts boiling, add
  salt. (The batter already added will tend to form clusters- Don't worry -
  Can be fixed later) Add the couscous and mix thoroughly (use a potato
  masher and get rid of any clusters by mashing them well). After the mixture
  has solidified, (This should not take more than 5-10 minutes) take the pan
  out of the heat and let cool.
  
  After the mixture has cooled, take a small portion of the mixture and make
  into a patty and set aside. (You can use some water and/or oil to make the
  patties if the batter is too sticky) The amounts mentioned in this recipe
  should yield about 30 patties. Serve with sphaghetti sauce or any spicy
  chutney.
  
  WARNING: If you don't like spicy food, reduce the number of green and red
  chillies.

  Let sit 5 more minutes. Add cooked couscous to chickpea mixture along with
  remaining ingr. except oil. Mix well, stopping the processor and scraping
  down the sides once or twice, until smooth. Lightly oil your hands. Shape 2
  to 3 . Tbl. of chickpea mixture between your hands to form a ball. Repeat
  with remaining mixture until you have 24 balls. Flatten balls to form
  patties about 2" wide and 1/2" thick. Brush croquettes with olive oil and
  place on a lightly oiled baking tray. Bake for 15 min, turn the croquettes
  over, bruth with oil and bake another 10-12 min. Makes 24 2" croquettes.

  1 3/4 c  Rice
      1    Lemon, juiced
           - or more, to taste
           Dill; very finely chopped
  1 3/4 c  -Hot water
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
 
  Sautee the onion with half the oil. Add the rice and let cook for a few
  minutes. Add the dill, the hot water and salt and pepper. Boil for about 5
  minutes. Let it cool.
  
  Steam the grape leaves and rinse with plenty of water in a collander.
  
  Wrap the rice mixture with the grape leaves. This is the most difficult and
  time consuming part, although after you are through it a couple of times
  you enjoy it the most. It is better if two people work on it
  simultaneously, talking, joking etc. You want to make them small in size
  (about 1-2 inches.) Do not hesitate to cut big leaves in half. Discard the
  central stem of these leaves and if you can reduce (with a sharp knife) any
  other tough stems it would be good. You want to wrap the rice very tightly.
  You place the rice in one end, fold from the short end and the two sides
  and then roll while pushing the rice downwards to pack it really tight. You
  have to do it a couple of times to understand. If they are not tightly
  packed they will unroll later. Also be careful to wrap totally, do not
  leave any holes.
  
  You arrange the dolmadakia in a casserole, tightly. Make more than one
  layers. Add the lemon juice, the rest of the olive oil and 1 1/2 cups of
  hot water. Cover them with a plate or something to keep them in place. Let
  them simmer for 35 minutes.
  
  Serve then cold, with strained yogurt or taramosalata. Enjoy.

      Title: Dolmades Yialandzi (Stuffed Grapevine Leaves)
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings: 60
 
    3/4 c  Olive oil
    1/2 sm Onion; chopped
      8    Scallions; chopped fine
      2 lg Garlic cloves; chopped
      1 c  Raw long-grain rice
      1 bn Fresh dill; chopped
    1/2 bn Fresh parsley; chopped
  1 1/2    Lemons (or more), juice only
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 c  Hot water
      1 lb Jar grapevine leaves
 
  Heat the 1/2 cup oil in a skillet.  Add the onion and scallions and saute
  for about 5 minutes, until soft and transparent.  Add the garlic and cook
  for a few minutes, then add the rice, dill, parsley, lemon juice, salt,
  pepper, and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil.  Stir well, then add the hot
  water.  Cover and simmer about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.
  
  Meanwhile, carefully remove the grapevine leaves from the jar, leaving the
  brine in the jar.  Wash grapevine leaves thoroughly and drain, then with a
  sharp knife cut the heavy stems from the leaves.  (If using fresh
  grapevine leaves use the same procedure, parboiling leaves for 5 minutes
  when not tender, then drain.)  Line an enameled pan with a few heavy
  grapevine leaves and set aside.  To stuff a grapevine leaf, put it on your
  working surface rough side up and stem end near you, and place a
  teaspoonful of the rice mixture near the stem end.  Using both hands, fold
  the part of the leaf near you up and over the filling.  Then fold the
  right side of the leaf over the filling, then the left side, and roll
  tightly and back away from you and toward the pointed end of leaf.  Place
  the "dolma", seam side down, in the prepared pan.   Continue stuffing
  grapevine leaves until the mixture has been used.  (If any grapevine
  leaves remain, replace in the reserved brine for future use.)  Place an
  inverted plate on the dolmades, then add enough water to cover the
  dolmades (about 1 to 1-1/2 cups).  Bring to a boil, then cover the pan,
  lower the heat, and simmer as slowly as possible for 1-1/4 hours, then
  taste one to see if the rice is tender, and continue cooking slowly if
  necessary.  Cool, then chill.  Serve cold, as an appetizer or as an
  entree.
  
  Note:  An important variation, particularly in Macedonia and Thrace: add a
  few tablespoons of raisins and pine nuts to the filling when adding the
  rice.  Also, you may vary the size of dolmades as you wish by adding 1-1/2
  teaspoons of the filling.  However, be consistent to allow them to cook at
  the same rate.  They may be stored in the refrigerator for a week or so.

 Categories: Thai, Vegetarian, Vegan, Pasta, Main dish
   Servings:  2
 
      2 tb Oil
      1    Garlic clove; finely chopped
      2 sm Fresh red or green chilis
           -- finely chopped
      4 oz Sen yai noodles
      1 sm Onion; cut into segments
      1 md Tomato; cut into segments
      4    Kaffir lime leaves
           -- roughly chopped
      6    Sweet basil leaves
      1 ts Dark soy sauce
      2 tb Light soy sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 sm Sweet red or green pepper
           -- finely chopped
 
  This is a favourite hangover dish - the chilis kick-start the benumbed
  body while the lime leaf refreshes and clears the jaded palate.
  
  In a wok or frying pan/skillet, heat the oil until a light haze appears.
  Add the garlic and chilis and fry until the garlic is golden brown.  Add
  the noodles, stir, add the remaining ingredients and stir well until the
  peppers begin to cook but are still al dente.  Turn on to a dish.

      2 tb Cider Vinegar
      1 tb Maple Syrup (or sugar)

--------------------------------NOW TRY THIS--------------------------------
 
  Directions: Place soy milk in food processor (or blender).  Put on lowest
  setting.  Drizzle oil into soy milk.  Add other ingredients.
  I add about the same amount of lemon juice in addition to the vinegar.
  Someatimes I add one tablespoon of dry mustard.  You've got to try adding
  basil and/or sage and/or oregeno.
  
  I've also never had a problem adding all the vinegar, syrup, salt, etc. to
  the soy milk first and then adding the oil.
  
  You cannot fail.  Try it.

  Taste to adjust seasonings.  Add the bread crumbs to absorb excess liquid.
  
  Stuff the eggplant shells, if desired, and place in an oiled baking dish.
  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 35 minutes.  Serve warm - or
  particularly good - cold.

      1 pn Paprika; (generous)
 
  Drain the dried beans and place in large saucepan with cold water to cover.
  Bring slowly to a boil, drain and rinse.  Rinse out the saucepan, return
  the beans to the pan, and add cold water to cover by 3 inches. Bring to a
  boil, reduce the heat, cover, and gently simmer 25 to 30 minutes, or until
  soft.  Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Remove the fava bean
  skins with your fingers and spread the beans between layers of paper towels

  onion, garlic, carrot, celery, and bay leaf over medium-low heat for 15 to
  20 minutes, or until dark golden brown, stirring occasionally with a wooden
  spoon.
  
  Transfer to a food processor or blender container and add the bread.  With
  the machine running, add about two thirds of the lemon juice and 2
  tablespoons of the olive oil, and process until thick and smooth.  Add a
  few tablespoons of water if the puree seems too thick, and add salt,
  pepper, olive oil, and/or lemon juice to taste.
  
  Serve on a platter, sprinkled with the remaining parsley and olive oil and
  the paprika.
  
  To make the traditional way:  Pound the cooked vegetable-bean mixture and
  the bread in a large wooden mortar for 5 minutes.  Slowly add about two
  thirds of the lemon juice and then 3/4 cup of the olive oil.  Pound for 5
  minutes longer, and add salt, pepper, olive oil, and/or lemon juice to

  skillet to 375.  Fill the bowl of a tablespoon w/batter and use a second
  spoon to scoop it into the oil.  It may help to oil the spoon, but I
  haven't had any problems.  Don't fry more than four at a time because
  they get done in less than a minute and if you leave them longer they'll
  burn and the fat content will skyrocket.  Drain and serve.
  
  For the tomato sauce I recomend your basic homemade tomato sauce w/o any
  bay leaf but some extra red wine.  Figger it out for yourself.  If you
  can't make your own tomato sauce you've already read too far;-)

   Servings:  4
 
      3 tb Olive oil & margarine, mixed
      1 c  Tomato juice or sauce
      1 lb Fresh green beans

  Heat the fat in an enameled pan and mix in the tomato juice or sauce.  Add
  the green beans and parsley to the pan with enough water to almost cover.
  Tuck the potato slices in between, partially cover the pan, and simmer for
  25 minutes, the stir and season with salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons
  chopped mint.  Cook uncovered until the beans and potatoes are fork
  tender, about 10 more minutes.  If the sauce has not thickened, pour it
  into a small pan, and boil down to one cup, then combine with the beans
  and potatoes in a warm serving bowl.  Sprinkle with a little additional
  fresh mint and serve warm.  Excellent with grilled chops, fish or egg
  dish, but equally good as a main course with cheese.

      1 c  Olive oil

      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
           -OR- basil
 
  Cecila came up with this combination for actress Darryl Hannah, a
  vegetarian who cooks for meat eaters.  The Philippines-inspired cold
  tomato and lime dressing is compatible with grilled fish or chicken as
  well as mushrooms.  To prevent the bamboo skewers from splintering in the
  heat of the fire, soak them in cold water for about half an hour and place
  them in the freezer for a few minutes before cooking.
  
  Combine all marinade ingredients in a glass or ceramic bowl.  Add the
  mushrooms, toss to coat and set aside to marinate for 1 hour at room
  temperature.

  DRAIN THE BEAN CURD AND CUT IT into 2-inch squares. Set to drain further on

  and all the filling ingredients and stir-fry for 1 minute. Put the cooked
  ingredients in a bowl and allow them to cool thoroughly. Heat a wok or
  large saute pan until it is hot. Add the 2 cups oil and, when it is hot,
  deep-fry the bean curd on both sides until it is golden brown. Remove the
  bean curd squares from the wok, drain them well on paper towels, and allow
  them to cool thoroughly. Drain and discard the oil. Take each of the bean
  curd squares and, with a knife, split it slightly open on one side so a
  pocket is formed. Place a spoonful of cooked filling in each of the
  pockets. Continue to fill the squares until you have used all the bean
  curd. Wipe the wok clean, reheat, and add 1 tablespoon oil. Then add the
  garlic and ginger, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Then add the rest of the
  ingredients except the cornstarch mixture and sesame oil. Bring the mixture
  to a boil, return the fried bean curd pieces and cook over medium heat for
  3 minutes. Now add the cornstarch mixture, stir gently to combine, and then
  add the sesame oil. Give the mixture a final turn and serve at once. Serves

   Jaffray taught us how roasting, crushing and grinding bring out different
  qualities in a spice. Crushing mustard seeds, for example, brings out
  their heat but tossing them 'til they pop in hot oil calms the heat and
  brings out a sweet nuttiness. Black mustard seeds, the finest mustard seeds
  are essential and inexpensive ingredient, found in Indian groceries."
  
  Trim and peel and grate carrots. In a bowl, toss with salt and set aside.
  In a small heavy pan over medium heat, heat oil. When very hot, add
  mustard seeds. As soon as the seeds begin to pop, in a few seconds, pour
  oil and seeds over carrots. Add lemon juice and toss.
  SERVES:4
  Serve at room temperature or cold.

           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Water
 
  Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F) Cooking time: 1-1/2 to 2 hours
  
  Remove stem from eggplant, wash well then peel off 1 cm (1/2 inch) strips
  of skin lengthwise at intervals giving a striped effect.  Cut long
  eggplants in 1 cm (1/2 inch) slices; oval eggplant should be quartered
  lengthwise, then cut into chunky pieces.  Spread eggplant on a tray and
  sprinkle liberally with salt.  Leave for 30 minutes, then pat dry with
  paper towels.
  
  Trim zucchini and cut into 4 cm (1-1/2 inch) pieces.  Remove stem and seeds
  from peppers and quarter.  Wash, trim and (if desired) de-fuzz okra. Soak
  in vinegar to remove slime.  Drain.
  
  String beans if necessary and slit in half (French cut).  Slice tomatoes.
  
  Heat half the oil in a frying pan and fry eggplant until lightly browned.
  Remove to a plate - do not drain.
  
  Add remaining oil to a pan, add sliced onions and fry gently until
  transparent.  Stir in garlic, cook 1 minute, then remove pan from heat.
  
  Place a layer of eggplant in the base of a casserole dish.  Top with some
  of the zucchini, peppers and beans.  Spread some onion mixture on top and
  cover with tomato slices.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper and some of the
  parsley.  Repeat until all ingredients are used, reserving some tomato
  slices and parsley.
  
  Place prepared okra on top if used and cover with last of tomato. Sprinkle
  with parsley, salt and pepper and add water and oil drained from eggplant.
  
  Cover casserole and cook in a moderate oven for 1 to 1-1/2 hours until
  vegetables are tender.  Serve from casserole as an accompaniment to roast
  or grilled meats or poultry.  Often this is served as a light meal on its
  own; bread and peynir (feta) cheese are then served with it.

 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
   Servings:  4
 
 
    1 c  dried red kidney beans, washed
         coconut milk (see NOTE)
    1 ea sprigfresh thyme
    1 ea clove garlic, crushed
    1 ea green onion, chopped
         salt, to taste
    3 sl hot pepper, such as Scotch Bonnet (optional) 2 1/4 c uncooked
  long-grain, regular or parboiled rice
  In a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, place the washed beans. Add
  the coconut milk and bring to boil.  Reduce the heat. Cook until the beans
  are tender, 1 to 2 hours.  Add the thyme, garlic, green onion, and salt.
  Add the hot pepper if desired. Simmer for a few minutes. Add the rice.
  
  The liquid should come up to 1-inch above the rice.  Add water if needed.
  Cover the pot.  Bring to a boil again.  Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 15
  minutes (for regular rice) to 20 minutes (for parboiled). It should not be
  necessary to add more water, but if to much liquid boils away, replace it
  with boiling water.
  
  The rice is ready when the liquid disappears and the grains of rice are
  separate.  Stir just before serving to evenly distribute the red kidney
  beans. Makes 4 to 6 servings.
  
  NOTE:  For coconut milk, crack 1 mature coconut with a hammer, cut off
       the brown shell, and grate the coconut meat.  Into a bowl, add
       the coconut meat and 6 cups of water.  Mix well, then squeeze to
       extract as much liquid as possible.  Press through a sieve and
       use as directed above.
  
       Etoria says his preferred method to separate the coconut
       meat from the brown shell is with a butter knife ("or the
       dullest knife you have") to prevent cuts.  Slip the knife
       between the white flesh and the shell, and it should come
       away easily.

  minutes, stirring frequently, then season with salt. Stir in potatoes and 1
  cup strained simmering stock. Cover and cook slowly 5 minutes. Add kale,
  cover again and steam until leaves are wilted, stirring once or twice.
  Strain remaining stock into soup pot. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer
  slowly, covered, until potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes. Use back of
  wooden spoon to break up potatoes by pressing them against sides of pot or
  puree 1 or 2 cups soup in blender and return it to pot to make unifying
  background for other elements. Taste soup and season to taste with salt and
  generous grinding of pepper. If possible, set soup aside 1 hour to allow
  flavors to merge and develop even further, then serve with light sprinkling
  of parsley.

      Title: Kaz's Vegetable Casserole
 Categories: Vegetarian, Kaz, Vegetables, Beans
   Servings:  2
 
      4    Mushrooms
      2    Onions
      5    Mange tout
    220 g  Chick peas
    400 g  Tomatoes with chili spices
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 tb Natural or hazelnut yoghurt
      1 tb White wine vinegar
      2 ts Brown mustard seeds
 
  White grape juice is just as good as white wine if you want to avoid the
  alcohol. The recipe works well without either.
  
  I made this one up when I couldn't be bothered to follow a recipe, so I'd
  be interested to know what you think of it. It is also nice with a crumble
  topping - I use an ordinary wholemeal crumble mix and add sunflower seeds
  to it, or cashew nuts, to give it a slightly nutty taste.
  
  Preparation: chop the onions into 2cm pieces and finely dice the
  :            mushrooms.
  
  Add all the vegetables to a casserole dish, then add the spices, chickpeas,
  yoghurt and white wine. If possible leave to marinate for a couple of hours
  to let the vegetables absorb the taste.
  
  Microwave on high (650w oven) for 15 minutes, or longer if you want the
  vegetables to be soft rather than crunchy - say 20 minutes.
  
  Serve with Biryani rice - I use brown rice with lentils, almonds, sultanas
  and a mixture of vegetables such as carrots and broccoli.

      Title: Koushari (Lentils, Macaroni and Rice in Oil)
 Categories: Egyptian, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings:  6
 
      1 c  Ads iswid (brown lentils)
           Water
           Salt
      1 c  Small macaroni noodles
      1 c  Short grain rice
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Tomato puree

---------------------------------TA'LEYA II---------------------------------
      2 lg Onions
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1    Garlic clove (or more)
           -- finely chopped
 
  This is classed as an 'oil' dish by Coptic Egyptians and is prepared
  during periods of fasting when animal products cannot be taken.  You may
  cook the lentils, macaroni and rice simultaneously in 3 pots, or if, like
  me, you like to keep pots to a minimum, use the method given.  This is the
  way they prepare it in Egypt anyway.
  
  Place lentils in a sieve and wash well under running water.  Place in a
  large pot and add 3 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt.  Bring to the boil,
  then simmer for 1 hour until tender but still intact.  Drain and keep
  aside.
  
  Clean same pot and add 4 cups water.  Bring to the boil, add 2 teaspoons
  salt and the macaroni.  Stir constantly until water returns to the boil
  and cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes until tender.  Stir occasionally.
  Drain and keep aside.  Clean pot again and dry.
  
  Wash rice well in sieve under running water and drain.  Heat oil in pot
  and fry rice over medium heat for 2-3 minutes.  Add 2 cups water and 1
  teaspoon salt and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally.  Cover and
  simmer over low heat for 15 minutes or until tender.  Leave covered off
  the heat for 5 minutes for grains to separate.
  
  Prepare the ta'leya (directions below), add tomato puree and bring to the
  boil.
  
  Add lentils and macaroni to cooked rice and toss together lightly with a
  fork.  Pour hot ta'leya and tomato mixture on top, toss again and cover
  pot.  Leave over low heat for 10 minutes.  Serve hot.
  
  TA'LEYA: Halve peeled onions lengthwise then slice thinly to give
  semicircles.  Heat olive oil in a pan, add onions and fry over medium heat
  until golden brown.  Add garlic and cook a minute longer.

      Title: Lentil Burgers
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Mark's
   Servings:  8
 
      2 c  Dried red lentils
           -Water, to cook
      1 c  Bread crumbs
           - (preferably wholewheat)
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
           - more to taste
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
  Wash lentils thoroughly & pick out any sticks & stones & grit which might
  get in them.  In a large pot, bring the water to a rolling boil.  Add
  lentils & cook for 20-25 minutes until the lentils start to puree.  Drain &
  let cool. It is not necessary to let them get cold.
  
  Transfer the cooked lentils to a large mixing bowl.   Add bread crumbs,
  garlic & onion & mix thoroughly.  Season well.
  
  You then can experiment with herbs & spices.  I usually add loads of cajun
  spice, with healthy measures of parsley, basil & majoram.  You could try
  thyme or sage.  It is your choice.
  
  If the mixture does not hold together well enough, add more bread crumbs.
  Form into patties & then cook as you would a regular hamburger in a little
  oil.  Or barbecue.  If they are really dry, then they hold together well
  enough to barbecue.
  
  Serve in buns with old fashioned dijon mustard & chips ooops, errrr fries.

      Title: Lentil-Walnut Burgers
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings:  6
 
    3/4 c  Dry lentils
  1 1/2 c  Water
      2 ts Cider vinegar
      1 tb Margarine
      1 c  Onion; finely minced
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
     10 lg Mushrooms; minced
    1/2 c  Walnuts; finely minced
      1 sm Celery stalk; finely minced
      1 ts Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Dry mustard
      1 tb Dry sherry
    1/2 c  Raw wheat germ
 
   This takes about 40 minutes to prepare: you can do "part 1" while "part 2"
  is cooking, plus about 1 hour to chill, then 15 minutes to cook.
  
   Makes between 4 to 6 servings, depending on the size of patties you make
  and the hunger of participants.
  
   Note: uncooked burgers may be individually wrapped and frozen.
  
  Part 1:  Bring lentils and water to a boil in saucepan. Lower the heat, and
  simmer, partly-covered, 30 minutes, or until lentils are soft, and liquid
  is gone.  Place in large-ish bowl.  Add vinegar, and mash.
  
  Part 2:  Saute remaining ingredients, except for wheat germ, together over
  medium-low heat 10 to 15 minutes, or until all is tender. Add to the mashed
  lentils, and mix well.  Add wheat germ and mix again. Chill for about 1
  hour.
  
  The Burgers:
  
   1. Make 4-inch patties from chilled burger-mixture.  For freezing, make
  patties, place wax paper between each patty and stack; wrap well and freeze
  (or wrap individually).
  
   2. Fry burgers in butter until brown, *or* broil about 8 minutes on each
  side.  Try putting sesame seeds in pan to keep burgers from sticking to
  pan, if it is a problem.
  
   3. Serve either as patties, or as burgers in a whole-wheat bun. Good with
  cheese melted on top, basil sprinkled on each burger is tasty also.

  Simply mix all ingredients until all is blended.Dough will be very
  sticky.Divide evenly into 2 oiled or sprayed with Pam loaf pans.Allow to
  rise until doubled (it's a pretty dense bread,but on a warm day,rising
  should be completed in about 4 hours) Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven
  for about 1 hour. Terrific for sandwiches or as a breakfast food!

      Title: Lone Dao Jiow (Dao Jiow Coconut Sauce with Fresh Vegetables)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Kaz, Thai
   Servings:  2
 
    1/2 c  Coconut Milk
   3/16 c  Brown bean sauce (dao jiow)
    1/4 lb Mixed vegetables
      1 tb Palm sugar
      1 tb Tamarind liquid
  1 1/2 sm Cucumbers
  1 1/2 sl Green cabbage
      3    Green beans
  1 1/2 lb Shallots
 
  Notes:
  
  For the mixed veg I use things like water chestnuts, green beans,
  cauliflower etc etc. The original recipe had pork and shrimp but I changed
  it, and it works fine :-)
  
  Preparation:
  
  Slice the shallots lengthways
  Use brown sugar if palm sugar isn;t available.
  Peel and slice the cucumbers diagonally into thick ovals
  trim the green beans
  cut the cabbage into two inc wedges
  
  1. In a small, heavy bottomed saucepan, bring the coconut milk to a gentle
     simmer over a low heat. Cook, stirring gently,until the coconut
     milk is fragent and it's oil glistens on the surface (about 6-8 mins)
  
  2. While it simmers, combine the bean sauce and half of the shallots in
     a mortar. Using a pestle, mash the mixture to a chunky paste.
  
  3. When the coconut milk is ready add the shallot paste and stir well.
     Add all the vegetables except the cucumbers, cabbage,green beans and
     the remaining shallots. Cook for five minutes
  
  4. Add the sugar and simmer until the shallots wilt and the sugar melts, 1
     to 2 minutes. Add the tamarind and taste the sauce, which should be a
     balance of salty, sour and sweet.
  
  5. Transfer the sauce to a small bowl and place it on a plate, garnished
     with the cucumbers, cabbage wedges and green beans. Serve warm or at
     room temperature.

      Title: Mark's Very Own Fried Rice
 Categories: Rice, Main dish, Vegetarian, Mark's
   Servings:  4
 
      4 c  Cooked rice
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      1 lg Carrot, scrubbed & diced
      1 md Green pepper, diced
    1/2 c  Frozen corn &/or peas
      1 ea 3" piece ginger root, sliced
    1/2 ts Chili pieces
           Soy sauce
           Salt & pepper, to taste
 
  Ensure that the rice has been cooked ahead of time & is well cooled.
  
  Heat about 2 to 3 tb vegetable oil in a wok.  When hot, add onions &
  garlic & fry for 3 minutes.  Add the carrots & stir-fry for 2 minutes.
  Add the rest of the vegetables & continue to stir-fry for 2 or 3 minutes.
  Toss in the chili pieces & ginger root.  Cook for a few seconds.
  Carefully stir in the cold rice.  Lower heat & continue to cook, stirring
  occasionally for 5 minutes.  Add enough soy sauce to coat the rice & cook
  for a further 5 minutes on low heat, stirring often to prevent sticking.
  Season if desired with salt & pepper.  Serve when heated through.
  
  This goes great with spicy tofu dishes or works well on its own as a main
  dish in its own right.
  
  If you desire something hotter, add more chili pieces. Use pieces rather
  than powder because they are hotter.
  
  For a variation, I sometimes toss in a few strips of tofu just before
  adding the spices.

      1    Egg (or egg replacer)
           - (beat egg if using)
      2 tb Soy sauce
           Salt and pepper to taste

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
     32 oz Canned chopped tomatoes
      6 oz Tomato paste
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large saucepan, heat oil and saute
  onions until lightly browned.  Add the TVP mince, stir and cook for
  two minutes.  Pour the hot water or stock over the saute and simmer
  for four minutes.
  
  In a separate bowl, mix the breadcrumbs, herbs and garlic together with
  one cup cold water.  Stir in the egg and leave to one side for ten
  minutes.
  
  Combine the cooked TVP mince with the breadcrumbs mixture, then add the
  soy sauce.  Stir well and season to taste.  Using your hands, shape
  the mixture into an oval mound and place it in the center of a large
  baking dish, leaving plenty of space all around for the tomato sauce
  to run.
  
  Heat the tomatoes, tomato paste and seasoning in a small saucepan,
  and pour over the loaf, then bake for one hour.  Serves 6.
  
  JTK's notes:  I usually add more herbs & chopped garlic, and saute chopped
  vegetables like celery, carrots, and/or mushrooms after onions are done but
  before adding TVP. Hot sauce is a good addition, too, or other flavored
  sauce like veg. Worcestershire. The egg replacer works fine --- not sure if
  it's even necessary. Also, I make the tomato sauce differently (sometimes I
  use canned/jar or homemade frozen sauce, and I prefer canned whole
  tomatoes, pureed, to prechopped ones), but it doesn't matter much. I make
  breadcrumbs from whatever bread is available, preferably wholewheat
  (lightly toasted for dryness) --- doesn't matter much either. Cracker
  crumbs would probably do as well, if you don't have bread around or a food
  processor/blender.  I've made 1.5x recipe into a single loaf OK, but larger
  wouldn't work (would have to make separate loaves, if larger quantities are
  desired)
  
  makes 1 loaf, approx. 6x10" (fits comfortably into a 9x13" pan with
  a couple inches margin around for sauce --- see above). VEGAN/OVO.

  dressing. Some people like this; others (including the reviewer for Toronto
  Life!) do not. Time the addition of the croutons to suit your taste."
  
  Preheat oven to 350F. Spread the bread cubes on a large baking sheet & toss
  with the oil. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, turning them
  every few minutes. They will take 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how fresh
  the bread is. Assemble the cucumber, peppers, green onion and parsley in a
  large bowl; leave out the tomatoes for now. Prepare the dressing: Stir the
  lemon juice, salt and garlic together until the salt dissolves. Add the
  pepper, cinnamon and allspice, then slowly beat in the olive oil. (May be
  prepared up to 12 hours ahead to this point.) Place the cut up tomatoes on
  top of the other vegetables. Pour on the dressing and toss well; add the
  croutons and toss again (see note).

 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings:  6
 
------------------------RICE AND CHICK PEA STUFFING------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Chopped spring onions
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 c  Long grain rice
      1 c  Canned chickpeas; drained
    1/2 c  Finely chopped parsley
      1 c  Chopped, peeled tomatoes
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper

---------------------------------TO FINISH---------------------------------
     24    Cabbage leaves
      3    Garlic cloves
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Dried mint
    1/4 c  Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Olive oil
 
  Gently fry spring onion in 1/4 cup olive oil for 2-3 minutes.  Turn into a
  bowl and add remaining stuffing ingredients, adding salt and pepper to
  taste.
  
  Remove leaves from cabbage carefully so as not to tear them, counting
  larger leaves as 2.  Par-boil cabbage leaves in boiling water until limp
  enough to handle, cooking leaves in 2 to 3 lots.  Drain in a colander.
  
  Cut out larger part of centre rib in each leaf and cut larger leaves in
  half down centre.  Line base of a deep pan with ribs and any torn leaves.
  
  Place a generous tablespoon stuffing on base of each leaf, roll up once
  and tuck in sides to contain filling.  Roll to end of leaf.  Repeat with
  remaining ingredients.
  
  Crush garlic with salt and blend in crumbled, crushed mint and lemon
  juice.
  
  Pack rolls flap side down in lined pan, sprinkling some of the
  garlic-lemon mixture and olive oil between layers of rolls.  Invert a
  plate on top of the rolls to keep them intact during cooking.  Add enough
  cold water to just cover rolls and put lid on firmly.
  
  Bring to the boil on medium heat, reduce to low and simmer gently for 45
  minutes.  Remove from heat and leave aside for 30 minutes.  Serve lukewarm
  or cold.

      Title: Millet Loaf
 Categories: Vegan, Main dish, Grains, Pickarski
   Servings:  8
 
  1 1/2 c  Millet
  3 3/4 c  Water
      2 ts Sea salt
  1 1/2 c  Peeled, finely diced carrots
      1 c  Finely diced celery
      1 c  Finely diced onions
      1    Garlic clove; minced
      2 tb Sesame oil
  1 1/2 ts Dill weed
      1 ts Dried thyme
      1 c  Pistachio nuts (optional)
           -OR- roasted sunflower seeds
      3 tb Unbleached flour
      3 tb Gluten flour
 
  You can serve this versatile loaf for lunch or as an appetizer.  Place
  slices on a bed of Bibb lettuce with vegetable garnishes and a light,
  creamy salad dressing.
       ************************************************************
  
  Rinse the millet and put it in a medium saucepan with the water and 1/2
  teaspoon sea salt.  Cook the millet, covered, over medium heat for about
  30 minutes or until soft; the millet should absorb all of the water.  (If
  the grains are too moist, the loaf will not bind properly.)
  
  Saute the carrots, celery, onions, and garlic in oil for 6 minutes, or
  until the onions are translucent.  Add the seasonings, including the
  remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt.  Mix the cooked millet and the
  vegetables together, along with the nuts or seeds, if you wish.  Mix the
  two flours together and add them to the millet mixture, blending it well
  so the loaf will hold together.
  
  Lightly oil and flour a large loaf pan.  Press the millet mixture into the
  pan and bake in a preheated oven at 400 degrees F for about one hour.  (If
  the millet mixture is warm when you put it in the pan, reduce the baking
  time to about 45 minutes.)  Allow the loaf to cool for 10 minutes, then
  carefully remove it from the pan.  To avoid breaking the loaf, you may
  wish to slice it while it is still in the pan.

   Servings:  8
 
    1/2 c  Wild rice
    1/2 c  Pearl barley
    1/2 c  Brown rice
    1/4 c  Oil
      1 lg Onion; thinly sliced
      4    Garlic cloves; chopped
      4 tb Unsalted butter or margarine
           -OR- Oil
    1/2 lb Mushrooms; thickly sliced
  3 1/2 c  Broth
      1 ts Crushed dried thyme
    1/2 ts Crushed dried oregano
           Salt & pepper; to taste
 
  Combine grains in a mixing bowl and set aside. Pour the oil into a 2-3 qt.
  casserole
  which is safe for both stovetop and oven cooking, and place on med. heat.
  When hot , saute onion and garlic until tender and translucent, about 5-6
  mins. Add the mixed grains and saute for 1 min., stirring constantly.
  
  Meanwhile melt butter or margarine (if using) in a separate pan on med.
  high heat. When hot , add mushrooms and saute quickly, stirring frequently,
  until the shrooms are hot and have just absorbed the "butter" (about 1
  min.). Immediately remove from heat.
  
  Add the broth, herbs, and mushrooms to the casserole with the onions and
  grains, and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste, cover
  tightly (use aluminum foil between pot and cover if necessary for a good
  seal), and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hr.
  
  NOTES: I use alot less oil (only as much as needed to keep things from
  sticking in my cast-iron dutch oven), add hot peppers and fresh herbs
  (rosemary is especially delicious; i dislike dried oregano so i use less or
  none), add soy sauce instead of salt, and saute the mushrooms first in the
  same pan (taking them out when done) so i dont have to wash two pans :^>.
  Frankly i can't see where they get 8 servings from, this lasts me maybe 3
  meals....It's really a hearty dish, so save it for a cold day (some of us
  still have a few left, despite the advent of spring). Enjoy!

      2 ea Hot green chilies, quartered
    2/3 c  Cooked chick peas
      3 tb Almonds

      3 tb Sunflower seeds
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Turmeric

  tender-crisp.  Drian, saving the water.  Add the frozen peas, defrosted
  first, to the steamed vegetables.
  
  In a blender, while it is running, drop in the chilies.  Add the chick
  peas, nuts & seeds & process until the peas are mashed.  Some vegetable
  water may facilitate this.  Add the cauliflower, potatoes, fresh peas, if
  using, & beans.  Pulse on & off till they are coarsely mashed.  Transfer
  to a mixing bowl, add the steamed vegetables, salt, pepper, turmeric &
  garam masala.  Mix well.  Divide into portions.
  
  Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.  Flatten a portion into an almond
  shaped cutlet, 1/2 inch thick & place on the sheet.  Cover & refrigerate
  for 30 minutes.
  
  Whisk the soy milk, cornstarch & flour in a flat bowl until smooth.  Dip
  each cutlet into the batter, roll in poppy seeds & set aside briefly to
  air dry.
  
  Heat ghee to a depth of 3/4 inch.  Without crowding, fry the cutlets in
  batches for 2 minutes each side.  Drain & serve.

      Title: Mjaddra (Lentils with Rice)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish, Lebanese, Vegan
   Servings:  4
 
      2 c  Lentils
    3/4 c  Uncooked rice
      2 md Onions; chopped
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Allspice or bhar
 
  Clean and wash the lentils and boil them until tender.  Mash and strain
  into a separate pot.  Add the rice, salt, and spices, and mix well.  In
  a pan, saute the chopped onions in oil until golden.  Add them with the
  frying oil to the lentils and rice.  Bring the mixture to the boil with
  enough water to cover and simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes,
  until the rice is cooked, stirring regularly to prevent sticking.  Serve
  lukewarm or cold with radishes and spring onions or a cabbage salad.
  
  That's the recipe straight from the book.  I make a couple changes: first
  of all, I'm a bit liberal with the cumin and allspice - I don't use
  measuring spoons, and I'm sure I get more than the 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon.
  Bhar, btw, is described by the book as "a spice blend made of cloves,
  cinnamon and nutmeg.  It is very similar in flavor to allspice, which
  may be substituted for it."  I use brown basmati rice, so I have to boil
  it for more than 10 minutes; this means I have to keep adding water to
  it so it doesn't dry out.
  
  I mean to go back to the restaurant I first had this dish at and ask them
  what spices they use, since theirs is both spicier and darker than mine.

      Title: Mock Chopped Liver
 Categories: Spreads, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings: 12
 
      1 c  Dried Lentils;
           - cooked until soft, drain.
      1 lb Green beans
           - boiled or steamed until
           - cooked, but not mushy
    1/4 c  Peanuts (or more)
    1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
      2 c  Diced onions; sauteed in oil
           - until very soft
           - and turning brown
      2    Garlic cloves (or more)
           - (saute with the onions)
    1/4 c  Unsweetened peanut butter
           - (like Laura Scudders)
           - optional
           Salt & pepper to taste
           Spike seasoning
           - (if you have it)
 
  Blend it all in the food processor until smooth.  I do everything
  separately, then mix it all together because my food processor is not big
  enough to do it all at once.
  
  Serve as a sandwich spread, or on crackers.
  
  This recipe makes *a lot*.  I think it freezes well, just stir well after
  it thaws, and make sure the lentils and green beans are well drained. Serve
  with crackers or make sandwiches with it.  This recipe makes quite a lot of
  spread.

      Title: Mock Fish Buddhist
 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegan, Buddhist, Chinese
   Servings:  1
 
      1 lg Potato; cooked, peeled
           -and sliced 1/4 inch thick
      2 tb Flour
           Peanut oil; for frying
      1 sm Onion; sliced
    1/2 lb Snow peas
     10    Wood ears; soaked to soften,
           - tough ends removed,
           - cut in slivers
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/3 c  Water
 
      Sprinkle potatoes with flour and deep-fry until golden.
   Drain and set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the oil,
  reheat an add onion. Stir-fry 10 seconds and add snow peas and
  wood ears. Stir-fry another 10 seconds and add salt, sugar and
  water. Bring to rapid boil, stirring constantly, and cook until
  peas are just tender crisp. Add reserved fried potato slices,
  heat through and serve.
  
      Wood ears are a type of mushroom or shelf fungus. When
  soaked it has a crunchy, gelatinous texture with little taste. If
  you can't find them, I imagine that you could use the dried
  mushrooms although they wouldn't give exactly the same effect. A
  closer substitute would be dried jellyfish, but if you're some-
  where that sells dried jellyfish, I'm sure that they have wood
  ears as well...

  In a soup pot, saute the onions in the ghee for 5 minutes.  Add chili,
  cayenne, turmeric & coriander.  Saute for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring.  Add
  the stock & the vegetables.  Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the

  omits the traditional chicken stock but adds the occasionally used
  chick peas.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegan, Main dish
   Servings:  4
 
  1 1/2 lb Firm tofu
      1 tb Oil
      3 tb Arrowroot
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 tb Agar flakes
      1 ts Dried marjoram
      1 ts Dried thyme
      1 tb Minced garlic
    1/2 ts Black pepper
  2 1/2 c  Cima mix (see below)

----------------------------------CIMA MIX----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onions
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Whole wheat bread crumbs
    1/4 lb Ground seitan
    1/4 lb Fine soy grits
    1/4 lb Hand crushed frim tofu
    1/3 c  Nutritional yeast
      2 ts Dried marjoram
      2 ts Dried thyme
      2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Chopped spinach, packed
    1/4 c  Chopped roasted red pepper
    1/2 c  Pistachios
      1 c  Green peas
      1 tb Agar flakes
    1/2 c  Gluten flour
      2 tb Liquid lecithin
 
  Rinse tofu and pat dry.  Cube and puree in food processor with all
  ingredients except cima mix.
  
  Shape the cima mix into a 12" by 3" roll.  Sread the tofu puree on a 12"
  by 28" piece of plastic wrap and roll around the cima log.  Smooth out
  the seam. Steam 30 minutes, let cool 10 minutes, slice and serve.
  
  Note:  you MUST have a steamer wide enough to support the entire roll
  from underneath!  If you don't, it will slip and come unrolled.  It'll
  still get cooked, but rather than a pretty, colorful roll to slice
  you'll have a serious mess.  This shouldn't be a problem, but for a
  broke person cooking for nine @someone else's apartment, these harware
  problems have a nasty way of only becoming apparently an hour before
  mealtime. (sigh)
  
  CIMA MIX: (makes 4 1/2C  Bro Ron suggests using the extra for
  'meatballs' or something.  Far be it from me to argue w/my hero, but
  remember to use a big enough skillet.)
  
  Saute onions in oil until translucent.  Remove from heat.  Add bread
  crumbs,
  tofu, seitan, soy grits, nut yeast, water and seasoning.  Mix until evenly
  dispersed. Add vegs and nuts.
  
  In a separate bowl, mix agar and gluten flour.  Heat lecithin and stir
  into veg
  mixture, then stir in flour/agar mixture.

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
      1 tb Sesame seeds
      1 tb Chopped scallion whites
      4    Cilantro leaves (optional)
 
  FOR THE ORANGE-TAHINI SAUCE:  In a blender or food processor, combine all
  ingredients.  Refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  FOR THE FILLING:  Melt the butter or heat the oil in a medium saucepan.
  Saute the onion until soft, about 10 minutes.  Add the rice and stir to
  coat with the butter.  Add the broth, bring to a boil, cover, and simmer
  over low heat until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 45
  minutes.  Let cool to room temperature.
  
  In a large bowl, toss together the cooked rice, Orange-Tahini Sauce,
  chickpeas, and raisins.
  
  Prepare the oranges for stuffing by slicing off the rounded ends so that
  each half stands squarely on a plate.  Using a paring knife, carve out the
  fruit, cut it into bite-size sections, and toss it into the rice mixture.
  Once the fruit has been removed, cut away as much of the white portion of
  the peel as possible, leaving the shell intact.
  
  Set the orange shells on a serving dish and fill them with the rice
  mixture.  Garnish each with a sprinkling of sesame seeds and scallions
  topped with a whole cilantro leaf.

  done, scoop it out and add it directly to the greens and beans. Toss them
  together, then turn into a heated serving dish. Drizzle the remaining olive
  oil over the top, season with plenty of pepper and freshly grated cheese.

      Title: Polenta with Tomatoes & Olives
 Categories: Vegetarian, Side dish, Vegan
   Servings:  6
 
      8 oz Polenta
      3 oz Stoned olives (optional)

----------------------------FOR THE TOMATO SAUCE----------------------------
  1 1/4 lb (generous) canned tomatoes
      1 lg Onion
      1 tb Olive oil
           Garlic, bay, rosemary, thyme
           -- (or herbs of your choice)
 
  Bring 1-3/4 pints salted water to the boil.  Reduce the heat to low and
  add the grain as though you were making porridge: let the polenta trickle
  slowly through your fingers and stir the contents of the pan very
  vigorously all the time to prevent lumps forming.  Cook over the gentlest
  possible heat for about 20 minutes, stirring more or less continuously -
  like porridge and semolina, polenta is a great sticker.   The mixture is
  ready when it begins to come away from the sides of the pan, is perfectly
  smooth and so thick that your wrist aches from stirring.  Away from the
  heat beat in 1 tablespoon oil, the stoned olives if using them, and some
  salt and pepper.  Use the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to grease the
  interior of an 11-12 inch frying pan.  Turn the polenta into the frying
  pan, pack it down smoothly and level the top with an oiled spoon.  Set
  aside for a couple of hours until the polenta is cold and solid.  Loosen
  it with a palette knife, turn it out of the pan and cut into 6-8 wedges.
  
  To make the sauce, chop the onion finely and sweat it in the oil for 10-12
  minutes.  Add the roughly chopped tomatoes and their juices, several
  cloves of finely chopped garlic and a little bouquet of rosemary, bay and
  thyme, or plenty of well-flavoured herbs of your choice.  Let the mixture
  bubble away gently for 40 minutes or so, just stirring occasionally, until
  reduced to a rich and fragrant sauce.  Remove the bouquet of herbs, season
  with salt and pepper and add extra fresh chopped herbs to taste.
  
  Fry the wedges of polenta in very hot olive oil or unsalted butter, or a
  mixture of the two, for 4-5 minutes on each side until lightly crusted and
  heated right through.  Serve piping hot with the garlicky tomato sauce,
  and with a bowl of olives or grated Parmesan if you wish.  In the Veneto
  polenta sometimes accompanies small silvery fried fish, or a dish of
  Fergato alla Veneziana.  Quail or other tiny game birds threaded on to
  skewers and cooked on a spit, or a saute of chicken livers, and grilled
  sausages, are other good choices but polenta can be served on its own just
  as well.

      Title: Polenta
 Categories: Main dish, Grains, Vegan, Pickarski
   Servings:  8
 
      1 tb Olive oil; or corn oil
      1 c  Peeled, finely diced carrots
      1 c  Finely diced onions
      1 c  Finely diced celery
      1 tb Minced garlic
      2 ts Sea salt
    1/2 ts Finely ground black pepper
      1 ts Chopped basil
      4 c  -Water
    1/2 c  Drained stewed tomatoes
      2 c  Yellow corn grits; -OR-
  2 1/4 c  -Cornmeal
      1 c  Cooked, drained kidney beans
 
  Heat the oil in a large saucepan.   Saute the carrots, onions, celery, and
  garlic, along with the salt, pepper, and basil, for about 8 minutes.  Cut
  the stewed tomatoes into small pieces and add them to the vegetables,
  along with the 4 cups of water.  Bring to a simmer.  Then add the corn
  grits and kidney beans and mix well.  Cook for about 20 minute, stirring
  occasionally to prevent burning.  (The polenta may take longer than 20
  minutes to cook.  Check by tasting.  It should have a soft, gritty
  texture.)
  
  Lightly oil a 2-quart mold and press the polenta into it, working out any
  air pockets.  Smooth out the surface and allow it to cool to room
  temperature.  Refrigerate the mold until it is cold.  Then unmold the
  polenta onto a tray, garnish it, and serve it in slices.
  
  NOTE: If you are using cornmeal instead of corn grits, it is best to soak
  the cornmeal separately, in 2 cups of cold water; add the remaining 2 cups
  of water to the vegetables and then combine the two mixtures.
  
  VARIATION: Millet Polenta
  Use 2 cups of millet and 5 cups of water in place of the corn grits and
  the 4 cups of water.

    1/2 ts Cloves
      1 ts Soda
      2 ts Water
      1 ts Baking powder
 
  (the name comes from the fact that the cake calls for no eggs, no milk, and
  no butter)
  
  *NOTE:  (Since the shortening is melted, I substituted Canola oil, thus, I
  think, saving a LOT of cholestrol and saturated fats!)
  
  Boil brown sugar, 1 1/4 C water, oil or shortneing, raisins and spices
  together for three minutes.  Let cool to room temperature.
  
  Add salt and baking soda, dissolved in 2 tsp water.  Sift together flour
  and baking powder, add gradually, beating after each addition.
  
  Grease and flour 8" square pan.  (I used nonfat spray instead).
  
  Bake at 325 for approximately 50 minutes, until it tests done.
  
  Needs no frosting.
  
  (would be HEAVENLY with a big blob of whipped cream...but it's really
  unnecessary.  this sucker is GOOD!)

      Title: Potato Patties
 Categories: Snacks, Appetizers, Indian, Vegetarian
   Servings:  6
 
      6 md Potatoes
      3 tb Yellow split peas
           Salt
      2 tb Oil
      5 ea Fenugreek seeds
      2 tb Chopped onions
      3 tb Parsley
      1 ea Fresh hot green chili
 
  Two hours before using, boil the potatoes in their jackets.  While they
  are boiling, boil split peas in 3 cups water with a sprinkling of salt for
  15 minutes.  Remove from heat & drain very well, ensuring that you get rid
  of all the excess water. Set aside in a covered bowl.
  
  In a skillet, add the oil & heat over a medium flame until it is very hot.
  Add the fenugreek.  When they change colour, add onions & fry for 2
  minutes, till the onion starts to brown.  Add parsley, green chili & stir
  another 2 minutes.  Next, put in the split peas, a little more salt if
  desired & cook, stirring for 5 minutes or until you are sure that all the
  water has evaporated.  The mixture should become one lump.  Cover & set
  aside.
  
  Peel & mash the potatoes with a fork or hand masher, do not use an
  electric beater otherwise your patties wil lnot hold together when cooked.
  A few lumps will remain, but get it as smooth as you can.  Add somec salt
  & mix thoroughly.
  
  Divide the potatoes into 12 balls & do the same with the split pea
  mixture.  Flatten each potato ball in you hand, put one portion of the
  split pea mixture in the centre.  Roll up into a ball again & flatten once
  more into a patty.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
  
  To cook the patties, you need very little oil & some patience so as not to
  lose the crust to the skillet when you turn them over.  Coat the bottom of
  the skillet with a small amount of oil.  Cook no more than two patties at
  any one time in each skillet.  Cook for 7 minutes, gently turn over & cook
  for another 7 to 8 minutes.  The patties should be reddish brown on each
  side.  Keep the heat fairly low otherwise they will burn.
  
  Serve with chutney.

      Title: Quinoa Loaf
 Categories: Main dish, Vegan, Grains, Pickarski
   Servings:  6
 
  1 1/2 c  Quinoa
      3 c  -Water
    1/2 ts Sea salt
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 c  Finely diced celery
    1/2 c  Finely diced fennel
      1 c  Finely diced onions
      4 ts Minced garlic
    1/2 c  Finely diced red bell pepper
      1 ts Sea salt
      2 tb Sesame seeds
  1 1/2 c  Cooked pinto beans
      4 tb Tahini
      4 tb Whole wheat flour
           -(stone-ground)
      4 tb Gluten flour
 
  Place the quinoa in a medium saucepan along with the water and 1/2
  teaspoon salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, until all the water
  has evaporated (about 15 minutes).  Set aside.
  
  Heat the oil in a medium saucepan.  Saute the celery, fennel, onions,
  garlic, and bell pepper, along with the salt, marjoram, and cardamom, for
  about 5 minutes.  Stir occasionally to prevent burning.  Add the cooked
  quinoa and the sesame seeds, pinto beans, and tahini to the sauteed
  vegetables.  Blend the ingredients.
  
  Mix the two flours together and blend into the vegetable and quinoa
  mixture. Line a large loaf pan with a baking sheet liner and lightly oil
  the liner.  (In lieu of the baking sheet liner, you could just oil and
  flour the pan.)  Press the mixture into the pan.  Bake at 400 degrees F
  for about 45 minutes.  (The loaf should reach an internal temperature of
  180-200 degrees F.)  Let the loaf cool, inverted, for 10 minutes before
  removing it from the pan.  Serve the loaf in slices, with your favorite
  tomato (or other) sauce if desired.

 Categories: Grains, Salads, Herbs, Vegan
   Servings:  1
 
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Quinoa
      3 md Ripe tomatoes
      1 c  Parsley
      1 c  Scallions
    1/3 c  Freshly squeezed lemon juice
    1/3 c  Safflower oil
      2 tb Fresh mint
           Salt; to taste
 
  Note:  The author says that 1 tsp. dried mint could be used, but dried
  mint is nasty stuff, IMHO!
  
  Pour water into a 1-quart saucepan.  Add quinoa; bring to a boil.  Reduce
  heat to a simmer; cover.  Cook for 10 to 15 min., or until all water has
  been absorbed.
  
  While the quinoa is cooking, finely chop the tomatoes, parsley, and
  scallions.  Add lemon juice, oil, and mint to tomato mixture.  Stir in
  cooked quinoa and salt.  Mix well.
  
  Let tabouli sit in the refrigerator for a day to blend flavors.
  
  Note:  Also, she neglected to mention that tabouli is traditionally served
  at room temperature.
  
  The recipe was from Linda Najjar of Seattle, Washington, and the "Herb
  Companion" note on it said:  "Substituting quinoa for the traditional
  bulgur wheat gives this tabouli a lighter, fluffier, and slightly nutty
  taste and enables people allergic to wheat to experience the flavorful
  joys of this Middle Eastern dish."

      Title: Republica Dominicana Red Beans & Rice (Arroz Con Habijualas)
 Categories: Main dish, Dominican, Vegetarian
   Servings:  1
 
-----------------------------------BEANS-----------------------------------
      1 c  Dry red beans *
      3 c  -Water (approx.)
      3 c  -Fresh water
      1 tb Cumin
      1 tb Raw sugar
      1 tb White vinegar
      2    Garlic cloves
           - peeled and chopped
      1    Onion; peeled and chopped
    1/2 ts Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ds Tabasco

----------------------------------FOR RICE----------------------------------
      1 c  Rice
  2 1/2 c  Water
 
  *NOTE: (red beans are not the same as kidney beans- they are smaller)
  
  Soak the beans in the water overnight or at least 8 hours. Drain the
  soaking water.
  
  Put the beans and all the rest of the ingredients into a large cooking pot.
  Bring the water to a boil, then reduce to moderate-low heat and cook for
  about 1 hour, until most of the water is absorbed. Add more water if you
  need to, and stir the beans every 10 minutes or so.
  
  When the beans have 1/2 hour to go, make the rice. Put the rice and water
  in a saucepan, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover. Simmer
  until all the water is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Then turn the heat off
  and let sit, with cover on, about 10 minutes.
  
  To serve, serve the beans over the rice.
  
  Serve with sliced avocado (aguacate), fried plaintain chips (platanos
  fritos), and cornbread (served fried like hush-puppies). For dessert serve
  fruit such as papaya with coconut, and expresso coffee (for Dominican style
  expresso: fill up your demitasse cup 1/2 full of raw sugar, then add
  outrageously strong expresso coffee!).

      Title: Rhubarb Raisin Crumble
 Categories: Vegetarian, Desserts, Fruits, Vegan
   Servings:  8
 
      3 lb Rhubarb; trimmed *
    1/2 c  Strawberry preserves **
    1/2 c  Raisins
      1 tb Finely grated orange zest***
      2 c  Granola, pref. maple walnut
           Maple syrup to taste
 
  *Note: Rhubarb should be in 1-inch slices.
  **Use fruit-sweetened preserves.
  ***Use organic if possible.
  
  Combine ingredients in a heatproof pan 13x8x2 inches. The combined
  ingredients will seem dry; don't be concerned; the rhubarb will give up
  considerable liquid as it cooks. Place pan in a cold oven, set temperature
  to 375 F, and bake uncovered for 15 minutes. Stir and continue baking
  until rhubarb is tender but still firm, about 10 to 15 minutes more.
  
  Add maple syrup to taste if more sweetness is desired.
  
  Notes: This recipe makes a big batch; it can easily be cut in half. When
  stored in the refrigerator overnight, this dish takes on a pudding-like
  texture.

 Categories: Egyptian, Sauces, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings:  1
 
      2    Garlic cloves
           Salt
    3/4 c  Tahini
      1 tb White vinegar
      1    Lemon; juiced
    1/2 c  -Water
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
 
  Crush garlic cloves with 1/2 teaspoon salt.
  
  Place tahini in mixing bowl and beat well.  This preliminary beating
  reduces the strong flavour of the tahini.
  
  Beat in garlic and vinegar.  Gradually add lemon juice alternately with
  water.  To make a cream salad of good consistency add enough lemon juice
  to make the tahini very thick before adding water.  This way you have more
  scope in adjusting the flavour and consistency of the sauce.
  
  Add salt to taste, and more lemon juice if a sharper sauce is required.
  Blend in cumin and parsley and chill until required.  Serve as a mazza or
  as directed in recipes.

      Title: Samosas
 Categories: Appetizers, Indian, Vegetarian
   Servings: 10
 
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
      3 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 ts Salt
           Vegetable oil to deep fry
      7 md Boiled potatoes
     10 tb Vegetable oil
    1/8 ts Asafetida
      1 ts Whole fennel seeds
      1 ts Whole cumin seeds
      1 ts Whole black mustard seeds
     12 ea Whole fenugreek seeds
      3 ea Whole dried red chilies
    1/2 ts Turmeric
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  To make the pastry, combine the 2 c of flour with 3 tb oil.  Add salt &
  mix.  Add 1 cup of water a little at a time until you have a firm dough.
  Knead the dough well for 10 minutes or until the dough is elasticy &
  smooth.  Form inot a ball, brush with a little oil, cover with a damp
  towel & set aside.
  
  To make the filling:
  
  Boil the potatoes & let them cool.  You may peel them if you like,I choose
  not to.  Dice them into bite-sized pieces.
  
  In a wok or very large skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  When very hot,
  drop in the asafetida.  5 seconds later, add the fennel & cumin seeds.  A
  few seconds later add in rapid succession the mustard seeds & fenugreek.
  As they begin to change colour & pop, add the chilies.  As soon as the
  chilies swell & darken, add the potatoes, turmeric & salt.  Fry gently,
  carefully turning the potatoes so as not to break them.  Fry for 15 to 20
  minutes until the potatoes are unevenly browned.  Add lemon juice & mix
  well.  Check the salt.  Remove potatoes from the wok, place in a serving
  dish & crush coarsely with the back of a slotted spoon.
  
  Divide the dough into 28 to 30 equal balls.  Flatten each ball & roll it
  out on a floured surface until it is approximately 4 inches in diameter.
  Cut each round in half.
  
  Taking one semicircle at a time, moisten half the length of the cut edge
  with a finger dipped in water.  Form a wide cone with the semi-circle,
  using the moist section to overlap 1/4 inch & hold it closed.  Fill samosa
  3/4 full with stuffing.  Moisten the inside edges of the opening & press
  it shut.  Seal this end by pressing down on it with a fork as you would a
  pie crust.  Do all the samosas this way, keeping them moist in a plastic
  wrap or under a damp towel until you are ready to fry.  (I find that I
  save a lot of time & anguish by frying them as I go).
  
  Heat the oil for deep frying in a wok.  When the oil is hot, slide in 3 or
  4 samosas, be careful not to overcrowd.  Fry until the samosas are brown
  on all sides, about 2 or 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon & drain
  on paper towels.  Repeat until you have 60 samosas.  The oil should be
  hot, but do not use a high heat otherwise they will burn.
  
  Serve samosas hot with a sweet chutney or tamarind paste.  They can be
  frozen & re-heated in a 300F oven.

      Title: Sauteed Green Beans and Mushrooms
 Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Roberts
   Servings:  6
 
      1 lb Fresh green beans
      2 tb Kosher salt
    1/2 lb Mushrooms
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      3 tb Pine nuts
      1 ts Chopped fresh tarragon
           -=OR=-
    1/4 ts -Dried tarragon
 
  SNAP BOTH ENDS OFF THE BEANS and pull off any strings. Cut large pole beans
  crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Don't cut smaller French haricots verts. Fill
  a mixing bowl or medium pot with 4 cups cold water and add 1 tray of ice
  cubes. Set aside. Bring 4 quarts of water with 2 tablespoons kosher salt to
  a boil over high heat and add the beans. The water will stop boiling when
  you add the beans. After it has returned to the boil, cook the beans,
  uncovered, until tender but still crisp. This will take from 3 to 5 minutes
  depending on the size and age of the beans. Remember that this is only a
  preliminary preparation so do not overcook the beans. Drain the beans and
  place them immediately into the ice water. Stir until cool, then drain.
  Spread the beans on towels and pat dry. Meanwhile, slice mushrooms thinly
  and set aside on a plate. Heat the oil and butter in a medium skillet over
  medium heat and add the pine nuts and mushrooms. If using dried tarragon,
  add it now. Cook, stirring, about 5 minutes. Add the green beans and fresh
  tarragon and cook until beans are hot, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to
  a serving platter and serve immediately.

      Title: Scallion Cakes
 Categories: Breads, Chinese, Vegan
   Servings: 10
 
      1 lb All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Coarse-grain sea salt
           -OR- kosher salt
      5    Scallions; coarsely chopped
      5 tb Vegetable oil (or more)
 
  Place the flour in a mixing bowl.  Sprinkle evenly with the baking powder
  and sugar.  Mix with a wooden spoon.  Add the water gradually, stirring
  and mixing with the wooden spoon.  Knead the dough for 3-4 minutes.  Cover
  it with a damp cloth and leave for half an hour, then knead again for 2-3
  minutes.  Divide the dough into ten portions and form into narrow strips
  8-10 inches long.  Flatten the strips with a rolling pin and ten bands of
  pancake thickness.  Sprinkle each band with salt and then with chopped
  scallions.  Roll the bands lengthwise into long double-thickness
  spaghetti-shaped strips.  Hold one end of the strip and turn the other end
  around in circles until the concentric rings form themselves around the
  center into a spiral pancake.  Flatten the pancake with the palm of the
  hand.  Repeat until the dough has been made into ten spiral pancakes.
  
  Heat the oil on the bottom of a large flat-bottomed frying pan.  When hot,
  lift the handle of the frying pan so that the surface of the pan is evenly
  greased.  Place the spiral pancakes on the surface of the pan.  Fry over
  low heat for 2-1/2 to 3 minutes and turn the pancakes over.  Repeat and
  fry gently until the pancakes are evenly browned on both sides.

      Title: Scrambled Tofu
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Vegan, Sass
   Servings:  2
 
      1 tb Olive or canola oil
      1 lg Onion
           - peeled & coarsely chopped
      2 lg Garlic cloves
           - peeled & finely chopped
      6    Scallions; thinly sliced,
           - (keep white & green parts
           -  separate)
    1/4 lb Mushrooms; thinly sliced
      1 sm Red bell pepper
           - seeded and diced
      1 lb Silken or soft tofu; drained
           - mashed or crumbled
    1/2 ts Dried leaf oregano
    1/4 ts Tumeric (optional)
    1/4 c  Finely chopped green olives
           -(pitted)
      1    Sheet nori sea vegetable
           - finely shredded (optional)
           Tamari or soy sauce
           - to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Hot sauce (optional)
 
  Great for brunch or a light supper dish, this recipe can easily be doubled
  to serve 4 to 6.  Silken tofu results in a very soft-cooked texture, while
  soft tofu will be slightly firmer.
  
  NOTE: Tumeric will give a faint yellow color to the mixture, but will not
  contribute significantly to the taste.
  
  DIRECTIONS: In a large skillet or wok, heat the oil and saute the onion,
  garlic, and white of scallions until the onions turn light brown, about 4
  to 5 minutes.
  
  Add the mushrooms, red pepper, tofu, oregano, and tumeric (if using), and
  continue to saute over medium-high heat for another 3 minutes, stirring
  frequently.  Stir in the scallion greens, olives, nori (if using), soy
  sauce and pepper to taste.  Pass optional hot sauce.

      Title: Seitan - Method I
 Categories: Misc, Information, How-to, Vegan, Pickarski
   Servings:  1
 
      6 c  Whole wheat bread flour
           -(Stone-ground), -=OR=-
           -Hi-gluten unbleached white
      3 c  Water (or more),
           -(depending on the amount
           - of gluten in the flour)
    1/2 c  Tamari
     12 sl Fresh ginger
           -(each about 1/8" thick)
      1    Piece kombu, about 3" long
 
  Yield: 14 ounces uncooked; 16 ounces cooked
  Time: 1 hour preparation; 2 hours cooking
  
  Mix the flour and water by hand or in a machine to make a medium-stiff but
  not sticky dough.  Knead the dough by hand on a breadboard or tabletop,
  until it has the consistency of an earlobe, or by machine until the dough
  forms a ball that follows the path of the hook around the bowl.  You may
  need to add a little extra water or flour to achieve the desired
  consistency.  Kneading with take about 10 to 12 minutes by machine.  Allow
  the dough to rest in a bowl of cold water for about 10 minutes.
  
  While the dough is resting, prepare the stock.  In a large pot, bring to
  boil 3 quarts of water.  Add the tamari, ginger, and kombu, and cook for
  15 minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.  This stock must be cold
  before it's used.  (The cold liquid causes the gluten to contract and
  prevents the seitan from acquiring a bready texture.)  You will be using
  this stock to cook the seitan later.
  
  To wash out the starch, use warm water to begin with.  Warm water loosens
  the dough and makes the task easier.  Knead the dough, immersed in water,
  in the bowl.  When the water turns milky, drain it off and refill the bowl
  with fresh water. In the final rinses, use cold water to tighten the
  gluten.  If you wish, save the bran by straining the water through a fine
  sieve; the bran will be left behind.  Save the starch by allowing the
  milky water to settle in the bottom of the bowl; slowly pour off the water
  and collect the starch, which you can use for thickening soups, sauces,
  and stews.
  
  When kneading, remember to work toward the center of the dough so that it
  does not break into pieces.  After about eight changes of water, you will
  begin to feel the dough become firmer and more elastic.  The water will no
  longer become cloudy as you knead it.  To make sure you have kneaded and
  rinsed it enough, lift the dough out of the water and squeeze it.  The
  liquid oozing out should be clear, not milky.
  
  To shape the seitan, lightly oil a 1-pound loaf pan.  Place the rinsed
  seitan in the pan and let it rest until the dough relaxes.  (After the
  dough has been rinsed for the last time in cold water, the gluten will
  have tightened and the dough will be tense, tough, and resistant to taking
  on any other shape.)  After it has rested for 10 minutes, it will be much
  more flexible.
  
  Seitan is cooked in two steps.  In the first step, the dough is put into a
  large pot with about 3 quarts of plain, boiling water.  Boil the seitan
  for about 30 to 45 minutes, or until it floats to the surface.  Drain the
  seitan and cut it into usable pieces (steaks, cutlets, 1-inch chunks, or
  whatever) or leave whole.  Return the seitan to the cold tamari stock.
  Bring the stock to a boil, lower temperature, and simmer in the stock for
  1-1/2 to 2 hours (45 minutes if the seitan is cut into small pieces).  The
  second cooking step may also be done in a pressure cooker, in which case
  it would take between 30 to 45 minutes.
  
  To store seitan, keep it refrigerated, immersed in the tamari stock.
  Seitan will keep indefinitely if it is brought to a boil in the tamari
  stock and boiled for 10 minutes twice a week.  Otherwise, use it within
  eight or nine days.
  
  VARIATIONS: Instead of boiling the seitan in plain water and then stock,
  let the seitan drain for a while after it has been rinsed.  Slice it and
  either deep-fry or saute the slices until both sides are brown.  Then cook
  it in the tamari stock according to the recipe.
  
  Seitan also may be cooked (at the second step) in a broth flavored with
  carrots, onion, celery, garlic, tamari, and black pepper, which will give
  it a flavor similar to pot roast.  Shiitake mushrooms may also be added to
  the stock.

      Title: Seitan - Method II
 Categories: Misc, Information, How-to, Vegan, Pickarski
   Servings:  1
 
     16 c  White bread flour
      6 c  -to
      8 c  Water, or more
    3/4 c  Tamari
      1    Onion; peeled and sliced
      1    Piece kombu, about 4" long
    1/4 c  Ginger; sliced   -=OR=-
      2 ts -Ginger powder
 
  Yield: 1-3/4 lbs uncooked; 2-1/2 lbs cooked
  Time: 40 to 50 minutes preparation: 3 to 4 hours cooking
  
  Mix the flour and water together to make a medium-stiff dough.  Knead it
  until it is elastic when pulled (about 8 to 10 minutes).  Allow the dough
  to rest for about 5 minutes in a bowl of cold water.
  
  Wash out the starch by filling a large bowl (1-1/2 to 2 gallons) with warm
  water and kneading the dough in it, underwater.  When the water turns
  white (after 1 to 2 minutes), drain it through a strainer, adding the
  floury residue back to the ball of dough.  Keep kneading, washing, and
  changing the water, until no more starch is given off.  This may take as
  many as eight rinses, about 20 to 25 minutes.
  
  Pour 6 pints of water into a large pot.  Add the tamari, onion, kombu,
  ginger, and dough, and simmer for about 3 hours.  (To speed up the
  cooking, you could cut the dough into small pieces, each about 1-1/2"; the
  pieces would cook in about one hour.)  The seitan is properly cooked when
  it is firm to the touch and when it is firm in the center.  You can check
  by cutting into the seitan.  If it is not done, it will feel like raw
  dough in the center.

      Title: Seitan a la Normandie
 Categories: Vegan, Main dish, Pickarski
   Servings:  4
 
      4 c  Sliced onions
      2 tb Minced garlic
      2 tb Sesame oil
           -OR- other cooking oil
      4    Pieces of seitan, 2 oz each
           - fried and simmered
           -(SEE NOTE IN DIRECTIONS)
      6 tb Tamari
      4 tb Apple juice concentrate
      1 c  -Water
    1/2 c  Ground, roasted pecan nuts
           -(Optional; this dish is
           - more delicate without it)
      3 md Apples; peeled, cored,
           - and thinly sliced
      2 tb Mirin or calvados or sherry
 
  NOTE: This recipe needs uncooked seitan.  Cut the seitan into four thin
  pieces (1/8 to 1/4 inch thick), each about 2 ounces.  The thinner the
  better.  Fry the seitan in a (little?) hot oil until lightly browned and
  then simmer it in a little water for about 30 minutes before using.  If
  you don't simmer it first, you may need to add more liquid to the recipe.
  
  Saute the onions and garlic in the oil until the onions are soft and
  translucent but not fully cooked.
  
  Place the seitan in an ovenproof baking dish and cover it with tamari,
  apple juice concentrate, and water.  Cover with the sauteed onion mixture
  and sprinkle the ground pecans over it, if you wish.  Fan the apples over
  the onions and pour the mirin on top.  Cover the dish with a tight-fitting
  lid or aluminum foil, and bake at 300 degrees F for 2 hours.  Serve hot.

      Title: Seitan Parmigiana
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings:  4
 
     12 oz Seitan; cut into "steaks"
      4 tb Oil; for frying
      3 c  Spaghetti sauce
      1 md Onion; chopped
           -and sauteed in water
           - (optional)

-----------------------------------BATTER-----------------------------------
      1 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/4 c  Corn meal
  1 1/2 c  Water
    1/4 ts Salt

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
 10 1/2 oz Soft silken tofu
      1 ts Maple syrup
      2 ts Italian herbs
           -(marjoram, sage, oregano,
           - basil, thyme, rosemary)
    1/4 c  Tahini
      1 ts Miso
      1 pn Nutmeg (optional)
 
  For BATTER: Mix together flour, corn meal, water and salt to make a thin
  batter.  Let sit for at least 10 minutes. Dip pieces of seitan into batter.
  Pan fry in oil on both sides until brown.
  
  Combine topping ingredients together in a blender and blend until smooth.
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pour 1 cup sauce into a 9" x 13" baking dish,
  distributing evenly.  Place batter fried seitan on top. Spread onions on
  top of seitan.  Pour on remaining sauce and top with tofu topping. Bake for
  30 minutes.
  
  This is a fairly close approximation to what a parmigiana dish should be
  like.  It is based on the mushroom stroganoff from the American Vegetarian
  Cookbook, and comes from Renee Wheeler.

    1/2 c  Red vinegar
    3/4 oz Onion; chopped
    1/8 ts Salt
           Paprika; to taste
      1 tb Dry mustard
  1 1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce

    1/4 c  Salad oil
    1/4 oz Toasted sesame seeds
           Peanut butter; to taste
           Roasted garlic; to taste
 
  Prepare like a vinaigrette dressing. The dry mustard will be the emulsifier
  for the oil and vinegar.
  
  This won't have the peanutty taste that the other has, but you can
  experiment with the addition of peanut butter and garlic in this recipe. My
  suggestion is 2 tbsp of PB and 1 tbsp of roasted garlic.
  
  Also, you may want to convert this recipe. It yields about 1 1/2 quarts.

  Karen's note:  This recipe has been resized to make about six 2-tablespoon
  servings, so it will now yield about 3/4 cup of dressing.  The notes from
  John regarding peanut butter and roasted garlic were for the original
  recipe, so you may decrease them as desired.

  Notes:
  
  The amount of garlic can be varied according to taste; like this it has a
  strong flavour.

    1/4 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Corn oil
           --(or canola oil or

    1/4    Nutmeg
      1 ts Carob powder (optional)
      1 pn Tumeric (optional)
 
  Grind the almonds first in the blender dry.  Add the rest of
  the ingredients and in a blender until light and fluffy.
  Can be served cold or hot (do NOT boil!).  For variation
  sprinkle the top with some anise seed and/or coriander, or,
  orange or lemon rind gratings, or, powdered cardamom.  If
  your soy milk is not very sweet, then add a little honey to
  the above.  If you can't find soy milk powder, then try
  thickening the soynog with, say, with 1/2 to one fresh
  banana.  If you want that slippery taste of "real" eggnog
  then just add more oil, but I think is better to simply
  allow your taste preferences to adapt and come to enjoy this
  soynog on its own terms   :-)

      Title: Spanakopita Nistisimi (Lenten Spinach Pie)
 Categories: Appetizers, Main dish, Greek, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings:  8
 
      1 lb Curly endive
      3 lb Fresh bulk spinach
           -washed, large stems removed
      3 bn Large scallions
           - white and green chopped
           - together
      5 tb Fruity olive oil
      1    Lemon
  1 1/2 c  Finely chopped fresh dill
      1 ts Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb Rice or cracked wheat

-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
           Extra flour for rolling
      1 ts Sea salt
      1 ts Baking powder
      5 tb Olive oil (about)
      1 tb Sesame seeds
 
  Start by making the pastry.  Sift the flour with the salt and baking
  powder. Mix in about 6 tablespoons water, a little at a time, until the
  dough is gooey, but not wet.  Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus another
  teaspoonful, and a little more flour, if needed, to make a cohesive mass.
  Knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.  Cover it
  and set aside to relax for an hour or two.
  
  For the filling, separate the curly endive leaves, so the vegetable will
  cook in the same time.  Steam the spinach and endive together in a large
  pan, in the water clinging to the leaves, plus just an extra 1/2 cup.
  Turn the leaves over occasionally, so they wilt evenly.  When they are
  wilted, but not mushy, drain them in a colander, pressing firmly with the
  back of a wooden spoon to remove as much excess liquid as possible.
  (Reserve the liquid for use in soup, or drink with a squeeze of lemon
  juice, as the Greeks do.)
  
  Saute the scallions in 2 tablespoons olive oil, until barely soft.  Add a
  few tablespoons of water if they stick to the pan.  Roughly chop the
  cooked spinach and curly endive and finely grate the zest from the lemon.
  Then toss the cooked vegetables with the scallions, parsley, dill, lemon
  zest and 1 tablespoon lemon juice, salt, and pepper, adding 3 tablespoons
  olive oil. Set aside until you are ready to fill the pastry.
  
  Choose an ovenproof earthenware or glass baking dish 2 to 2-1/2 inches
  deep and about 2-quart capacity and brush the inside with oil.  Divide the
  pastry into two unequal parts, and then again into halves.  On a floured
  surface roll out one of the larger pieces of pastry. This should be large
  enough to line the dish, coming up and over the sides - this should make
  it very thin.  Fit it into the baking dish and brush it with olive oil.
  Do the same with the second piece of pastry, placing it on top of the
  first, and brush again with olive oil.
  
  Sprinkle the tablespoon of rice or cracked wheat over the bottom, to soak
  up excess juices, and fill with the spinach and herb mixture.  Roll out
  the remaining two pieces of pastry, separately, to fit the top of the
  dish.  Place the first on top of the spinach, brush with olive oil, then
  place the second on top of that.  Prick the pastry with a fork in an
  attractive pattern and brush the entire top with olive oil.  Sprinkle with
  sesame seeds.  Bake in an oven preheated to 350 F for 45-50 minutes, until
  golden brown.

  Wash spinach well and cut off any coarse stems.  Chop coarsely and put
  into a large pan.  Cover and place over heat for 7-8 minutes shaking pan
  now and then or turning spinach with a fork.  Heat just long enough to
  wilt spinach so that juices can run out freely.  Drain well in colander,
  pressing occasionally with a spoon.
  
  Gently fry onion in olive oil for 10 minutes, add chopped leek and spring
  onions and fry gently for further 5 minutes until transparent.
  
  Place well-drained spinach in a mixing bowl and add oil and onion mixture,
  herbs and nutmeg.  Blend thoroughly, adding salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Place a sheet of fillo pastry on work surface and brush lightly with olive
  oil.  Top with 3 more sheets of pasry, brushing each with oil.
  
  Brush top layer lightly with oil and place half the spinach mixture along
  the length of the pastry towards one edge and leaving 4 cm (1-1/2 inches)
  clear on each side.
  
  Fold bottom edge of pastry over filling, roll once, fold in sides then
  roll up.  Place a hand at each end of roll and push it in gently like a
  concertina.  Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.  Place rolls in an
  oiled baking dish leaving space between rolls.  Brush tops lightly with
  oil and bake in a moderate oven for 30 minutes until golden. Serve hot cut
  in portions.

   Servings:  6
 
      1    1/2-inch-round ball tamarind
    1/4 c  -Boiling water
      1 lb Thin, long eggplant
      3 tb Light vegetable oil
  1 1/2 ts Minced garlic
      2 ts Ground coriander
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/2 c  Packed flaked coconut
           -- fresh or canned,
           -- unsweetened
      1 ts Cayenne pepper (or more)
    1/2 ts Coarse salt; or to taste
      2 tb Unsulphured molasses
           -OR- Brown sugar
    1/2 ts Black mustard seeds

---------------------------GINGER-TAMARIND SAUCE---------------------------
           -Tamarind residue from above
    1/2 c  -Boiling water
    1/2 ts Cornstarch
      1 tb Shredded fresh ginger
 
  Put the tamarind in a nonmetallic bowl.  Add 1/4 cup boiling water and let
  it soak for 30 minutes.  Mash the pulp and extract as much juice from it
  as possible.  Pour all liquid into a bowl, and save the fibrous residue
  for making the sauce.
  
  Slit the eggplants lengthwise to within 3/4 inch of the stem end so that
  each eggplant remains in one piece.
  
  Measure out the spices and place them right next to the stove in separate
  piles.  Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan or skillet
  over medium-high heat for 1 minute.  Add the garlic and fry for 30
  seconds.  Add the coriander, cinnamon, and cloves; fry for 15 more
  seconds.  Stir in the coconut and cayenne pepper; continue frying,
  stirring, until lightly toasted (about 2 minutes).  Turn off the heat and
  stir in the salt, tamarind liquid, and molasses, and mix well.
  
  Stuff the eggplants with the spicy coconut mixture.  Secure them by
  wrapping thread around them.
  
  Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same pan over medium-high heat.
  When it is hot, add mustard seeds.  Keep a pot lid handy, as the seeds may
  spatter and fly all over.  When the seeds stop spattering, add the
  eggplants in one layer.  Fry the eggplants, turning them often, for 3 or 4
  minutes.  Reduce heat to medium or medium low and cook them, covered, for
  10 to 12 minutes or until they are soft and cooked through.  Turn off
  heat.  Transfer them to a serving platter, pour Ginger-Tamarind sauce over
  them, and serve immediately.
  
  GINGER-TAMARIND SAUCE: Put tamarind residue in a nonmetallic bowl, add 1/2
  cup boiling water, and let soak for 30 minutes.  Mash the residue and
  extract as much tamarind essence as possible, squeezing it hard, into a
  bowl.  Discard the fibrous residue.
  
  Put tamarind water in a nonmetallic pan along with cornstarch, mix well
  and bring to a boil.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Turn off heat and stir in
  ginger shreds.
  
  Note: For a hotter flavor, stir 4 chopped hot green chilies into sauce.

      Title: Spicy Tofu Pate
 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings:  4
 
      1 lb Tofu (fresh)
    1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
    1/2 c  Wheat germ
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 ts Molasses
    1/2 ts Ground fennel
      1    Garlic clove; -OR-
      2 ts -Garlic powder
    1/4 ts Savory
    1/4 ts Powdered sage
    1/2 ts Allspice
      2 ts Oregano
      2 ts Dijon mustard, more to taste
           -(or any prepared mustard)
 
  Mash tofu in a large bowl. Add remaining ingredients, mix well
  with fork or by hand. Pack into small oiled casserole dish; cover
  with two or three paper towels. Steam 25 to 35 minutes on a rack
  inside a covered pot with water on stove or in a pan of water in
  the oven at 375 degrees.
  Top will brown slightly. Cool before removing from dish. Steaming
  blends flavors. Stores up to two weeks in fridge. Makes 2.5 cups.
  
  JTK's notes: I accidently used wheat bran instead of germ, and it still
  worked (kind of dry, though). I made this in a 2-qt. porcelain souffle
  dish,
  which it filled approx. 2/3.  I didn't have savory so I substituted fresh
  thyme. As usual, I added more garlic & hot sauce. Mash tofu very well, or
  you will have lots of tofu lumps --- I think I might try blending this in
  the
  food processor next time, to avoid this problem.  This was enough for
  maybe 4 days of lunches for me (pate on 4-5 Wasa breads/rice cakes per
  day).

      Title: Spinach Cooked in a Bihari Style
 Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Vegan, Indian
   Servings:  4
 
  1 1/2 lb Fresh spinach
           - washed and trimmed
    1/2 ts Freshly grated fresh ginger
      1    Garlic clove; mashed
    1/2 ts Minced fresh hot green chili
           -(very finely minced)
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Very finely minced cilantro
      2 tb Mustard oil
 
  This dish, traditionally made with mixed greens such as spinach and
  mustard, resembles an Italian pesto, though it is much thicker in
  consistency.  In place of olive oil, mustard oil is used, and apart from
  the taste of the greens themselves, the other strong flavors include raw
  garlic, raw ginger, green chilis, and cilantro.  If you can't obtain the
  pungent golden mustard oil which is called for in this recipe (available
  in Chinese as well as Indian groceries), steep 1/2 teaspoon powdered dried
  mustard in 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.
  
  In Northern India, this dish is eaten at room temperature for breakfast,
  along with fried bread and tea.  While raw garlic may seem alarming first
  thing in the morning, Indians consider it a medicinal necessity, and many
  swallow a crushed clove every day.
  
  DIRECTIONS:
  ==========
  Bring 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a large pot.  Add spinach and
  cook on high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until wilted.  Drain, rinse under
  cold water, and squeeze out as much liquid as you can easily.
  
  Put spinach in food processor or blender with 2 tablespoons water and blend
  until smooth.  This will result in a fairly thick paste.  Put in a serving
  bowl.
  
  Whisk together ginger, garlic, green chili, salt, cilantro, and oil.  Pour
  this dressing over the spinach and mix thoroughly.

  DIRECTIONS
  ==========
  Wash the tofu, pat it dry, and cut it into small pieces.  Put the tofu,
  arrowroot, soup base, salt, pepper, and agar flakes in a food processor
  and blend to a smooth paste.  Oil and flour the loaf pan (or line it with
  baking liner paper after oiling).  Spread a layer of tofu paste inside the
  pan, lining the bottom and all four sides.  (Spread only a thin layer on
  the ends.)  Use all but about 1 cup of the paste.
  
  Firmly but gently press the dressing into the pan, on top of the tofu
  paste "liner".  Try to avoid displacing the tofu.  Cover the dressing with
  the remaining tofu, carefully sealing the edges.  Cover the pan with foil,
  making certain the foil doesn't come in contact with the tofu.  (The tofu
  will eat into the foil.)
  
  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 F for 30 to 40 minutes.  Then remove the
  foil cover, glaze the top of the loaf with the dissolved barley malt
  syrup, turn the oven up to 450 F, and continue baking for 10 minutes.
  Remove from oven and allow the loaf to cool for about 10 minutes.  Unmold,
  slice, and serve hot with a sauce of your choice.
  
  SAGE DRESSING:  Saute onions, celery, carrots, and garlic in oil for 5
  minutes.  Add the sage, basil, soup base, salt and pepper, and continue
  cooking 5 minutes longer.
  
  Add the water and bring to a simmer.  Stir in the bread crumbs and cook
  for a few minutes.  Then remove from heat.

   Servings:  4
 
      2 lb Firm tofu
           - cut into 1 in. squares
  1 1/2 c  Dry red wine
    1/4 c  Tamari
      4    Garlic cloves; pressed

      4    Bay leaves
      1 ts Thyme
      1 ts Tarragon
      4 tb Whole wheat pastry flour
 
  Place the pieces of tofu in a large, shallow dish.  Mix together the wine,
  tamari, and garlic.  Pour the mixture over the tofu, add water as need to
  cover it, and let it marinate for at least one hour.  If the tofu is going
  to marinate for more than an hour, place in the refrigerator.
  
  Place the marinated tofu on a well-oiled cookie sheet, reserving the
  marinade.  Bake at 375oF for 35-45 minutes or until crispy and brown. Turn
  the tofu over once during the baking so that it browns on both sides.
  
  While the tofu bakes, heat the oil in a large pan and slowly saute the
  onions.  When the onions are almost tender, add the mushrooms and the
  herbs.  Saute for a few minutes more.  Add the flour and mix well. Remove
  the pan from the heat and stir in a little of the marinade. Continue
  stirring until a paste is formed.  Return the pan to the heat and slowly
  add the remaining marinade, stirring constantly.  Add the baked tofu and
  simmer until thickened.
  
  Serve over pasta, rice or millet.

     35 oz Canned Italian tomatoes
    1/2 lb Firm silken tofu
  1 1/2 c  Green peas
           -(pref. fresh, OR frozen)

-------------------------------GARAM MARSALA-------------------------------
      5    3" cinnamon sticks
      1 c  Whole cardamom pods
    1/2 c  Whole cloves
    1/2 c  Whole cumin seeds
    1/2 c  Whole black peppercorns
    1/4 c  Coriander seeds
 
  Heat the oil in a saucepan.  Saute the onions, garlic, ginger, salt,
  tumeric, cayenne, coriander, cilantro, and garam marsala for about 5
  minutes.
  
  Drain the juice from the tomatoes into the sauteed vegetables.  Then crush
  the tomatoes by hand and add them to the vegetables.  Dice the tofu into
  1/2-inch cubes and add to the vegetables.  Continue to cook for 10 to 15
  minutes over low heat.  Then add the peas and cook another 4 minutes.
  Serve hot over brown rice.  A coriander coconut chutney (or other chutney)
  is an excellent accompaniment.
  
  GARAM MARSALA:  Preheat the oven to 200 F.  Place the ingredients on a
  baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes, or until the spices give off an
  aroma.  (Some chefs suggest roasting each ingredient separately, since
  each gives its characteristic aroma at a different time.)
  
  Separate the cardamom pods from the seeds.  Discard the pods.  Crush the
  cinnamon.  Combine the cinnamon, cardamom seeds, and other spices until
  the mixture is powdery.  Store in a sealed jar.

  We LOVE this quick simple dish; sometimes I will substitute Zukes, or
  squash, or mushrooms for all or part of the tofu.   Enjoy.

  Pre-heat oven to 300F. Cut the marinated tofu slices lengthwise into 3
  strips per slice. Brush the tofu slices on all sides with oil and lay them,
  side by side, in a dish. The slices should not touch. Bake for 40 minutes.
  Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes.  Pass bamboo skewers
  carefully through the width of each slice.  Five to six slices will fit on
  one skewer without touching.  Cover with barbecue sauce and pre-heat the
  broiler. Broil 6 inches from the heat for about 5 minutes, turn over, and
  repeat. The tofu can become dark but scorching will make it bitter.

      1 tb Corn or canola oil
           -- (amount may be doubled)
      1 ts Minced ginger root
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      1 tb Curry powder; blended with:
      2 tb Water
      1 ts Cornstarch; blended with:
      1 tb Water
      1 tb Sesame oil
     20    Wonton skins
           Oil for deep-frying
    1/4 lb Fresh mushrooms; minced
      1    Soy sauce (or double amount)
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 ts Sherry
    1/4 ts Paprika
      1 ts Low sodium instant bouillon
           -- chicken, or vegetable
           -- (amount may be doubled)
 
  Dry the tofu and crumble into small pieces with a fork.  Heat oil in a
  nonstick wok; saute ginger root until brown.  Add chopped onion and
  blended curry powder; stir and cook for 2 minutes.
  
  Add tofu, mushrooms, soy sauce, pepper, sherry, paprika and bouillon;
  bring to a boil.  Add sesame oil and blended cornstarch; mix well.  Cool.
  
  Place a portion of the curried tofu (about 2 teaspoons) in the center of a
  wonton skin.  Fold the skin diagonally into the shape of a triangle.  Seal
  the edges with water.
  
  Heat oil for deep-frying.  Fry the tofu triangles until brown and crisp.
  Serve with vinegar, equal amounts of soy sauce and vinegar, or Sweet and
  Sour Sauce, or eat plain.  Makes 30 triangles.

      Title: Tofu Whip
 Categories: Sauces, Desserts, Vegan
   Servings:  1
 
      1 lb Firm or extra-firm tofu
           - drained & cut into chunks
    1/4 c  Maple syrup
      1 tb Vanilla
      1 tb Water, or more, optional
 
  It's light, fast, and a perfect complement to pies, puddings, and fruit
  compotes.  Tofu Whip can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week;
  if the mixture separates, blend it thoroughly before using.  The recipe
  may be cut in half.
  
  In a food processor or blender, blend all of the ingredients until very
  creamy, adding water if needed to achieve a whipped cream consistency.
  Refrigerate until needed.
  
  VARIATION: Instead of maple syrup, try 3 to 4 tablespoons of
  fruit-sweetened preserves and some finely minced citrus peel.  Choose the
  fruit and citrus flavors to complement the dessert.
  
  Makes about 2 cups

      Title: Topig (Lenten Chick Pea Kofta)
 Categories: Armenian, Main dish, Vegan
   Servings:  8
 
      2 c  Chick peas
      6 c  -Cold water
      2 sm Potatoes; boiled in jackets
  1 1/2 ts Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      3 lg Onions; halved & sliced
      2 tb -Water
    1/4 ts Ground allspice
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
    1/3 c  Pine nuts
    1/3 c  Currants
    3/4 c  Tahina
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper

----------------------------TO FINISH AND SERVE----------------------------
           -Boiling, salted water
           Olive oil
           Ground cinnamon or paprika
           Lemon wedges
           Parsley sprigs
 
  Serves: 8-12
  Cooking time: 35 minutes
  
  Soak chick peas in the cold water for 24 hours, in a cool place if weather
  is warm.  Remove the skins by taking a handful at a time and rubbing with
  the palms of both hands so that the chick peas actually rub against one
  another.  Drop back into bowl and take up another lot.  Skim off the
  floating skins as they accumulate.  (Dang, why not just leave the skins
  ON, this sounds like too much trouble! -KM)  Drain well.
  
  Pass the skinned chick peas through food grinder twice, using fine screen.
  Alternatively, place in food processor container in 2 lots and process to
  a paste (NOW you're talking! -KM)
  
  Peel skin from boiled potatoes and mash finely with a fork.  Combine with
  ground chick peas, add salt and a good grinding of white pepper.  Blend
  thoroughly and keep aside.
  
  Put sliced onions in a pan with the water, cover and steam over medium
  heat for 10 minutes, then remove cover and leave until moisture
  evaporates.  Turn into a bowl and cool.
  
  Add allspice, cumin, pine nuts, and currants to the onion.  Blend well,
  then mix in tahina, and salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Take 4 pieces of unbleached calico or similar cloth, each about 50 cm (20
  inches) square and scald in boiling water.  Cool a little, then wring out
  well.
  
  Open out a square of cloth on work surface and put a quarter of the chick
  pea paste in the centre.  Spread evenly with a spatula to a 20 cm (8 inch)
  square and place a quarter of the filling in the centre, spreading it a
  little.
  
  Bring each corner of the paste over the filling by lifting up corners of
  cloth.  Paste should enclose filling in envelope fashion.  Smooth joins to
  seal well.
  
  Make a single tie with each pair of diagonally opposite corners of cloth,
  then tie a second time.  Complete another 3 topigs in the same way.
  
  Half fill a large pot with water, bring to the boil and add about 1
  tablespoon salt. When briskly boiling, lower prepared topigs into pot and
  return to the boil.  Cover and boil steadily for 12-15 minutes or until
  topigs float and feel firm to the touch.
  
  Lift out immediately and place on a tray, draining off water in tray.
  
  Untie and invert topigs onto platter.  Leave until cool.
  
  When ready to serve, pour a little olive oil over each topig and dust
  lightly with cinnamon or paprika.  Garnish platter with lemon wedges and
  parsley.  To serve, cut each topig in half, then slice in thick pieces.
  Olive oil and lemon juice are added to individual taste.
  
  NOTE: Ready-skinned chick peas are available at some Armenian and Greek
  food stores.  These look like split peas, but are larger and nut coloured.

  mixture through a fine strainer, and season the liquid with salt and
  pepper.
  
  TO SERVE:  Pour coulis on 6 plates and place one serving of each grain on
  each plate.  Garnish couscous with fried sage leaves; garnish basmati rice

  To make shiitake duxelles, finely mince mushrooms and saute in oil
  with a pinch of minced shallot or onion.
  
  To fry sage leaves and zucchini for the garnishes, heat 3/4 inch
  of oil in a pan to 350 F (a drop of water should ripple and pop on
  surface of the oil); fry sage leaves for 1 minute, remove to a
  paper towel and drain.	Repeat with finely julienned zucchini,
  frying just until golden.

      Title: Tuscan Bread
 Categories: Breads, Italian
   Servings:  1
 
      1 oz Fresh yeast; -=OR=-
      2 pk -Instant dry yeast granules
  1 1/4 c  Warm water (125F)
  2 1/4 c  Unbleached white flour
    1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
 
  IN A LARGE BOWL, DISSOLVE the yeast in the water. Mix the 2 flours and stir
  them in to make a soft dough. Knead 10 minutes by hand, or 4 minutes in a
  heavy duty mixer with a dough hook. Oil a clean bowl and set the dough in
  it, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk. (In
  the traditional warm place, this will take about 2 hours. However, a cooler
  temperature will do as long as the dough has enough time to rise, including
  overnight in the refrigerator.) If the dough is ready sooner than it is
  needed, punch it down and refrigerate it or let it rise slowly again at
  room temperature until ready to use. Rub 2 to 3 tablespoons flour into a
  lintless dish towel and set the towel on a baking sheet. When the dough has
  completed its rising, punch it down, turn it out onto a floured work
  surface, and flatten it into an oblong about 8 inches wide, 10 inches long,
  and 1/4-inch thick. It will still be very soft, but try to use a minimum of
  additional flour in handling it. Roll the dough tight, jelly-roll fashion,
  into a cylindrical shape. Flatten this to about 1-inch thick and roll it
  again. (This activates the web of gluten that will keep the loaf from
  flattening out in the oven.) FOR A ROUND LOAF, tuck both ends of the
  cylinder under to meet in the center, pinching to seal them. Roll the dough
  around the work surface under your hands, to shape it into a smooth ball
  about 5 inches in diameter. FOR AN OBLONG LOAF, roll the dough under your
  hands into a fat cigar shape, extending it to about 10 inches in length.
  Set the loaf on the floured towel and fold the ends of the towel loosely
  around it. Put the covered loaf, on its baking sheet, in a warm place to
  rise for 1 hour. Preheat an oven lined with baking tiles to 400F. Have a
  water-filled sprayer handy. Slide your hand under the towel, pick up the
  loaf, and gently deposit it upside down on the tiles. Spray water into the
  oven before closing the door, and spray twice more at 2-minute intervals.
  Bake for 50 minutes or until golden brown. The bread should have a hollow
  sound when you knock on its bottom.

 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings:  8
 
      9    Lasagne noodles
           -(OR as much as needed)
      1 lb Tofu
    1/2 c  Tomato paste (or sauce)
      1    -to:
      2 c  Tomato sauce
           -(as much as desired)
      1 bn Chard (or spinach)
      3 tb Nutritional yeast
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Thyme
      1 ts Basil
      3 tb Canola oil
      3 sm Onions; -OR-
      1 lb Mushrooms
      3    Celery stalks
  1 1/2 c  Cauliflower
 
  Mash up the tofu in a bowl and add salt, nutritional yeast, spices,
  tomato paste.  Chop the celery, caulflower, and onion finely and
  saute in oil.  When mostly cooked add the mushrooms, sliced.  When
  the mushrooms are done, add the vegetables to the tofu and mix well.
  
  Cook the lasagne noodles in water until done.  This can be done
  beforehand to save time.  Grease your casserole pan lightly with some
  oil to help prevent sticking.  Place a layer of noodles down and spoon
  some tomato sauce over it.  Put a layer of tofu/veggies down.
  
  Saute the chard (or spinach) in a pan with just a little bit of oil.
  When completely cooked down and soft, add half to the lasagne,
  spreading evenly over the layer.  Add more sauce then noodles, then
  tofu than another layer of chard.  Top with more sauce, more noodles
  and a large amount of sauce (to prevent any burning or drying out of
  the noodles when they're cooked).  Preheat oven to about 350 or 375
  and cook roughly 35 minutes, or until bubbly and hot.  SERVE!  I
  guarantee it'll be among the best lasagne you've ever had....

      2    Squares bean curd

           - peeler and then shredded
      1 tb Tree ears; soaked in
           - warm water 20 min,
           - drained and chopped
      1 c  Bean sprouts
      1 md Carrot; peeled paper thin,
           - cut into 1 inch sections
           - and shredded
      1    White part of leek; chopped
      1 ds Black pepper
     10    Dried rice papers
           - (banh trang)
      2 c  Peanut oil
 
  ~- Combine all ingredients except rice papers and oil.  Cut the
  rice papers into quarters.  Wet the surface of each paper with water
  (use your fingers or a brush) and within about 1 min the paper will
  become flexible enough to be filled.  Place about 1 tbsp of the
  filling on each paper and roll.  Heat the oil in a wok to about
  350 deg. F.  Place rolls, flaps-down, into oil and cook 20 min
  (10 min each side), until completely done.
  
   Serve with Buddhist Nuoc Leo.
  
  ~- Disclaimer: This recipe is fat-city.  There is another form
  of spring roll skin which is inherently sticky and stretchy
  (white and barely opaque), and doesn't require deep frying.
  (One could lighly saute the carrots and potatoes beforehand.)
  I can't remember what this wrapper is called.  BTW - With this
  alternate type of "spring roll" fresh chinese parsley or cilantro is
  often included.

 Categories: Original, Vegan, Diabetic
   Servings:  6
 
      1    Onion, chopped
    1/2    Green pepper, diced
      2    Ribs Celery, diced
      1    Garlic clove; minced
      1 lb Okra, sliced, fresh, frozen
      1 lb Tomatoes, fresh, or canned
      2 c  Corn, fresh, frozen, canned
      1 ts Vegetable Bouillon granules
    1/2 c  White Grape Juice
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 ts Tabasco sauce
    1/4 ts Paprika
      2 tb Fresh chopped parsley
      1 tb Basil or Rosemary, minced
           Vegetable coating spray
 
  Method: In a large heavy stew pot, place bouillon and 1/2 C white grape
  juice, onion, green pepper, celery garlic, cook until tender, 5-7 minutes.
  Add other ingredients, cook over low heat, stirring occasionally to keep
  from sticking to bottom. Cover and simmer gently until corn and okra are
  done. (or simmer in crockpot 6-7 hours)
  
  Note:  Cut fresh corn from cob with a sharp knife, then scrape the
  remaining corn off the cob.  Four ears will make about two cups. If you use
  dried herbs, rub them with the palms of your hands before adding to the
  pot, this releases their aroma and goodness.

   Servings:  8
 
      1 c  Whole mung bean
           -- picked over and washed
      2 c  Long-grain rice
  4 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 ts Whole black mustard seeds
      1 md Onion
           -- peeled and finely chopped
      4 md Garlic cloves
           -- peeled and finely minced
      1 ts Peeled, minced ginger
    1/3 lb String beans; trimmed
           -- and cut into 1/4" pieces
      2 ts Garam masala
  1 1/2 ts Ground coriander
  2 1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Finely minced parsley
           -- preferably Chinese
 
  Put mung beans in a bowl with 3 cups water.  Cover lightly and set aside
  for 12 hours.  Drain beans and wrap in a very damp dish towel.  Put the
  wrapped bundle in a bowl.  Put this bowl in a dark place (like an unused
  oven) for 24 hours.
  
  Wash rice well and soak in 4 cups of water for half an hour.  Drain well.
  
  Preheat oven to 325 F.
  
  Heat oil in a wide, heavy, 4- to 5-quart ovenproof pot over a medium-high
  flame.  When hot, put in mustard seeds.  As soon as the mustard seeds
  begin to pop (this takes just a few seconds), put in the onion.  Stir and
  fry for about 5 minutes or until onion turns brown at the edges.  Add the
  garlic and ginger.  Fry, stirring, for about 1 minute.  Turn heat to
  medium-low and add the mung beans, rice, string beans, mushrooms, garam
  masala, ground coriander, and salt.  Stir and saute for about 10 minutes
  or until rice turns translucent and vegetables are well coated with oil.
  Add 4 cups hot water and the minced parsley.  Turn heat to a medium-high
  flame and cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until most of the water
  is absorbed.  (There will be an inch or so of water at the bottom.)  Cover
  the pot first with aluminum foil, crimping and sealing the edges, and then
  with its own lid.  Place in heated oven for half an hour.  Fluff up with a
  fork and serve.

      Title: Vegetarian Paella
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings:  4
 
    1/4 c  Olive oil
  1 1/4 c  Long-grain brown rice
      1 lg Onion; peeled and sliced
      2 lg Garlic cloves; crushed
      1 pn Saffron strands
      3 c  Light Vegetable Stock
           -(generous measure) OR water
    1/2    Lemon; thinly pared rind,
           - cut into thin shreds
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 lb Washed and trimmed leeks
           - cut into 1-inch lengths
    1/4 c  Frozen peas
    1/4 c  Black olives, or more

---------------------------------TO GARNISH---------------------------------
           Parsley; chopped
 
  Heat the oil in a large, deep pan.  Add the long-grain brown rice and onion
  slices and stir until the rice is coated and begins to turn opaque. Add the
  garlic, saffron, stock or wate, lemon rind and salt and pepper. Mix well,
  then bring to a boil.  Mix again, to distribute the saffron coloring.
  
  Arrange the vegetables and olives attractively on top of the rice. Bring to
  a boil.  Cover with a lid or foil and simmer for 45 minutes.
  
  Sprinkle with parsley and serve straight from the pan.
  
  May be served with blanched almonds, slivered Brazil nuts or whole cashew
  nuts- separately, in a bowl - for people to help themselves to if they
  like.
  
  Variation: VEGETARIAN PAELLA WITH ARTICHOKES: Use 4 to 6 globe artichokes
  instead of the leeks.  Very tender baby artichokes can simply be quartered;
  otherwise cut the leaves and choke from the artichokes, then halve or
  quarter the artichoke bottoms.  Garnish with artichoke leaves.

      Title: Wild Rice and Hazelnut Salad
 Categories: Salads, Nuts, Madison
   Servings:  6
 
    3/4 c  Wild rice
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Hazelnuts
      5 tb Currants
      1 lg Orange, juice only
           Citrus Vinaigrette
           - with Hazelnut Oil
           - (See RECIPE)
      1 sm Fennel bulb
           - cut into small squares
      1    Crisp apple
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Salt
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Rinse the wild rice, and soak it in water for a half
  hour, then drain. Add 4 cups fresh water and salt, and bring to a boil.
  Cook, covered, at a simmer until the grains are swollen and tender, but
  still chewy, about 30 to 35 minutes. Pour the cooked rice into a colander
  and let it drain briefly. While the rice is cooking, toast the hazelnuts in
  the oven, 7 to 10 minutes, or until they smell toasty. Let them cool a few
  minutes; then rub them in a small kitchen towel to remove most of the
  skins. Don't worry about any flecks of skins that won't come off. Roughly
  chop the hazelnuts, leaving the pieces fairly large. Rinse the currants in
  warm water and squeeze them dry; then cover them with the orange juice and
  let them soak until needed. Prepare the vinaigrette. Add the soaked
  currants and the fennel to the warm rice, and toss with the dressing. Just
  before serving, cut the apple into small pieces, add it to the rice, along
  with the hazelnuts, and toss. Season with freshly ground black pepper, and
  additional salt, if needed, and serve.

      Title: Wild Rice with Chestnuts
 Categories: Side dish, Vegan, Sass
   Servings:  6
 
      1 tb Oil
      5 md Shallots
           - peeled and finely chopped
      2    Celery ribs; finely chopped
      1 c  Wild rice; rinsed
    1/3 c  Dried, peeled chestnuts
    1/4 c  Dried currants
      2 ts Aniseed
    1/4 ts Sea salt; or to taste
      4 c  Water
      1 ts Finely chopped orange zest
           -OR- grated
 
  PRESSURE COOKER: Heat the oil in the cooker.  Add the shallots and celery
  and cook, stirring frequently, until softened slightly, about 1 minute.
  Stir in the rice, chestnuts, currants, aniseed, salt, and water.
  
  Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure.  Lower
  the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 25 minutes.
  Allow the pressure to come down naturally or use a quick release method.
  Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to
  escape.  If the rice or chestnuts are not quite cooked, return to high
  pressure for a few minutes.
  
  Drain (reserving the liquid for stock) and return to the pot.  Cover and
  let steam over low heat for a few minutes to dry out.  Fluff up as you
  stir in the orange peel.  Break up chestnuts into 2 to 3 pieces with a
  fork, if desired.
  
  STANDARD STOVETOP: Soak the chestnuts overnight.  Drain and reserve the
  water.  In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil.  Add the shallots and
  celery and saute for 1 minute.  Add the chestnut soaking liqiud plus
  enough water to equal 3 cups and bring to a boil.  Stir in the rice,
  reserved chestnuts, currants, aniseed, and salt.  Return to the boil,
  cover, reduce heat, and simmer until most of the grains have butterflied
  and almost all the liquid has been absorbed, about 50 minutes.  Let stand,
  covered, off heat for 10 minutes.  If there is still liquid left in the
  bottom of the pot, lift out the rice with a slotted spoon.

      2 tb Egg replacer (or arrowroot)
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Soy milk
      1 ts Salt
      4 tb Oil
      2 c  Flour
    1/2    Garbanzo flour

----------------------------------STUFFING----------------------------------
    3/4 c  Wild rice, uncooked
  2 3/4 c  Stock
    1/4 md Onion; minced
      2 sm Stalks celery; sliced thin
      2 tb Unrefined corn oil
    3/4 md Onion; chopped coarse
    1/4 lb Button mushrooms
           - sliced thick
      6    Shiitake
           - fresh or reconstitued,
           - quartered or eighthed
    1/2    Oyster mushrooms
           -OR- chanrerelles mushrooms
           -If using oysters, separate
           -them into small clumps,
           -if using chanterelles,
           -halve them
      1 lg Tomato; chopped
    1/2 ts Powdered sage
      1 pn Powdered thyme
      1 tb Shoyu
           Salt and pepper; to taste

-----------------------------NUTTY ALMOND SAUCE-----------------------------
      3 tb Unrefined corn oil
           -OR- soy margarine
      4 tb Unbleached flour
  2 1/2 c  Soy milk; heated
    1/2 c  Almonds
    1/4 md Onion; separated into leaves
      4    Cloves
           White pepper; to taste
      3 ds Freshly grated nutmeg
           Salt; to taste
 
  FOR CREPES: Blend the egg replacer w/1/2C water until smooth.  Add
  remaining ingredients and blend one minute at high speed.
  
  Heat a crepe pan or non stick 8" skillet over low heat, brush the bottom
  lightly w/oil (I use unrefined corn oil).  When pan is heated, take it
  off the burner, let cool about three seconds and pour 3-4T batter into
  it. Swirl the pan so the bottom is coated w/a thin layer of batter.  Put
  the pan back on the burner and cook until lightly browned.  Flip the
  crepe and cook until that side is lightly browned as well.  Repeat
  w/remaining batter.  This makes about a dozen crepes.  Note that you
  will inevitably screw up the first crepe or two, but it will become
  fairly routine after that.  Don't worry about it, I still do that after
  all these years.
  
  FOR STUFFING: Saute the onion in a little dry white wine for a minute or
  two, then add wild rice and stock, cover tightly, bring to a boil, turn
  heat to low and cook about an hour, until all liquid is absorbed.
  
  While the rice cooks, saute celery in oil until slightly tender, add
  onions and all mushrooms, and saute until all vegs are medium tender.
  Add cooked rice, tomato and seasoning and cook another ten minutes or
  so.  Fill crepes w/the mixture, roll them over it and heat in a
  preheated oven at 350 for about ten minutes.
  
  Serve w/Nutty Almond Sauce and garnish w/parsley and a twisted
  orange slice.
  
  FOR NUTTY ALMOND SAUCE: Toast almonds until golden, then pulverize.
  (Don't overgrind or you'll get almond butter.)
  
  Heat oil a few minutes in a heavy bottomed skillet, then stir in flour
  and cook 2-3 minutes on low, until fragrant.  Stir in soy milk and
  continue to stir until it begins to thicken, then stir in seasonings.
  Cover and cook 10 more minutes, but stir often to prevent scorching.
  Stir in almonds and cook another 4-5 minutes.
  
  Serve w/a simple spinach salad w/mustard vinaigrette and French bread,
  along
  w/a chilled white wine.

      Title: Wontons
 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Side dish
   Servings:  1
 
      2 tb Peanut oil
  1 1/2 tb Grated fresh ginger
      2 md Garlic cloves, pressed
      2 ea Tofu cakes, crumbled
    1/2 c  Finely chopped scallions
      2 ts Dark sesame oil
      2 tb Tamari soy sauce
     50 ea Wonton wrappers
           Bowl of lukewarm water
           Cornstarch for dusting
 
  Heat peanut oil in a wok.  Sizzle the ginger & garlic briefly then add
  tofu & stir-fry for a few minutes.  Add scallions, sesame oil & tamari &
  stir well.  Set aside to cool.
  
  Set up a work area with wonton wrappers, water & cornstarch.  Place a
  wrapper in front of you in a diamond position.  Drop a heaping teaspoonful
  of filling in the centre of the wrapper.  Moisten all 4 edges with water &
  pull the top corner down to the bottom, folding the wrapper over the
  filling to make a triangle.  Press edges firmly to make a seal.  Bring
  left & right corners together above the filling.  Overlap the tips of
  these corners, moisten with water & press together.  Place completed
  wrapper on the corn-starch platter & continue till all wrappers are used.
  
  FOR SOUP: Drop wontons into boiling water & cook for 5 minutes.  Drain.
  
  TO FRY: Heat 2 to 3 cups of oil in a wok till hot.  Deep fry wontons in
  batches till golden, 2 to 3 minutes on each side.  Drain.  Serve with
  dipping sauce or duck sauce.
  
  Uncooked wontons will keep in the freezer for a good 2 months if well
  wrapped.  Thaw before frying, but they can be boiled straight from frozen
  & cooked 2 minutes longer.

      Title: Zesty Green Split Peas
 Categories: Vegan, Low-fat, High fiber, Legumes
   Servings:  1
 
      2 c  Green split peas;uncooked
      8 c  -Water
      2    Bay leaves
    1/2 ts Ground tumeric
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Canola oil;(I used 2 Tsp)
      2 ts Ginger; peeled & minced
      2 ts Jalapenos; seeded & chopped
      4 tb Black mustard seeds; ground*
      3 tb -Water
      3 oz Coconut, shredded sweetened
      1 pn Soy margarine (optional)

--------------------------------FOR GARNISH--------------------------------
           Cilantro, chopped (optional)
 
  *If black mustard seeds are not available, use 1 Tbs dry mustard.
  
  Mix ground mustard powder in with water and allow to sit for 30 minutes.
  
  Bring split peas and water to a boil.  Lower heat to medium. Add bay leaves
  and tumeric (I forgot the tumeric--was good anyway). Simmer, covered, until
  peas are done, 40 to 45 minutes.  (When pressed between the thumb and the
  index finger, they break easily.) While simmering, uncover occasionally and
  stir, adding a Tbs or so of hot water if the mixture sticks to the bottom
  of the pan.  When cooked, remove and discard bay leaves. Add salt and keep
  warm.  Heat oil in a small, 6-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Saute
  ginger root and jalape o until ginger is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.
  Add mustard paste and cook for another minute, stirring constantly. Add
  coconut and stir several times. Remove from heat. Pour over the pea mixture
  and stir. (I had to drain my peas, because I still had lots of water in
  mine.)  Let stand covered for 15 minutes. Add a dab of soy margarine if
  desired and garnish with cilantro. (I didn't use the cilantro)
  
  I think this would make a good filling for pita pockets. I didn't think the
  peas were "zesty" enough, so I sprinkled hot pepper vinegar on mine.
