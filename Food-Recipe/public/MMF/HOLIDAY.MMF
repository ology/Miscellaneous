      1 c  Dry roast peanuts; unsalt
    1/3 c  Butter or margerine
      1 lb Marshmallows
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
      3 c  Puffed rice cereal
      1 c  Apricots; chopped
      1 c  Raisins
 
  In a large bowl, combine cereal, apricots, raisins and peanuts. In a
  microwave safe 13x9", melt butter and marshmallows on high for 2
  minutes. Stir; add peanut butter cook on high 2 minutes longer. Stir
  until well blended, add cereal mixture to dish and toss until well
  coated. Working quickly with greased hand, form into balls, using
  about 1/2 C mixture, per ball. If mixture begins to harden, cook on
  high for 30 seconds, or until softened. If desired , mixture may be
  spread in unbuttered 13x9" dish and cooled and cut into bars. Makes 1
  dozen balls or 2 dozen bars, This is very similar to the Rice Krispie
  treats, but with the apricaots and raisins it definitely gives it a
  fall look. I saw another idea of putting the mixture into cookie
  cutters, and letting it cool there so the shapes could be pumpkins,
  witches, etc. With a little gel piping they would be great.

      Title: Coating for your Thanksgiving Turkey
 Categories: Chicken, Condiment, Poultry, Holiday
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/3 c  Paprika
           Salt
           Garlic powder
           Onion; dried
           Pepper
           Water; to make paste
 
  This will do about a 13-15lb turkey.  Other seasonings are to taste. I
  never did measure. This is a coating you can put on all poultry before
  roasting.  Basically you make a paste of the above ingredients. It
  should be the consistencey of finger paint--thick and not runny. If
  you have kids, put them in old clothes and let them help. I smear it
  in and out of the cavity. Notice that this does not have any Gravy
  Master or oil...both unneeeded in my opinion. The skin cooks nice and
  crisp. Remember to baste during cooking.  BTW,  use this in the Nuke
  too.
   Sometimes we do a turkey or chicken in there when we have lot's of
  other baking/roasting to do.  When Howard was in training to be a
  Chef, he brought home a bunch of fellow students for dinner. Not one
  of them even came close to guessing that the turkey had been made in
  the nuke. I hope all of you have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.

      8    Whole allspice
           Salt and pepper
           Garlic powder
           Hungarian paprika
 
  5,6     lb brisket; 1st cut *Sliced paper thin (3 is not a typo) >>>
  The following is my favorite brisket recipe and it really does come
  from my Aunt Sadie's kitchen: Remove any excess fat from brisket, but
  leave a little on top. Place one half of the onions on bottom of pan.
  Season the onions with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder and lots
  of Hungarian paprika.  Place brisket on top of onions, then other
  half of onions and allspice on top of the brisket. Cover and roast in
  a 300 degree F. oven for 3 hours.
   Test your brisket and when it is fork tender, take it out. Let it
  cool and then slice it very thin.  Strain juice and either thicken it
  with a little cornstarch or serve it au jus. You will have a very
  dark brown juice. NOTE: Best when made one day in advance.  Aunt
  Sadie almost always served this with savory noodle kugel. I also
  serve it with roasted, boiled or mashed potatoes.  Use a good
  roasting pan with a lit that fits well or covered with heavy duty
  aluminum foil.

 Categories: Christmas, Poultry
      Yield: 12 servings
 
    1/4 lb Butter
      1    Turkey,fresh (12-16#)
    1/2 lb Salt pork,thinly sliced

MMMMM--------------------CORN BREAD STUFFING-------------------------
      2 pk Corn bread mix (10 oz)
    1/2 c  Celery,chopped
      1    Onion,medium,minced
    1/2 c  Butter
      2    Egg yolks
           Salt
           Pepper

MMMMM------------------------TURKEY STOCK-----------------------------
           Turkey giblets+neck & wings
      3 c  Water
    1/2    Onion,small,sliced
    1/2    Garlic clove
    1/2    Bay leaf
    1/8 ts Basil,crumbled
    1/8 ts Rosemary,crumbled
    1/8 ts Thyme,crumbled
    1/8 ts Salt

MMMMM--------------------TURKEY GIBLET GRAVY-------------------------
    1/4 c  Pan drippings
    1/4 c  Flour
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Turkey stock
           Turkey giblets,cooked,choped
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  1. Preheat oven to 425'F.
  2. Cut butter into very thin slices; place in freezer to harden while
  you prepare bird.
  3. Wash turkey inside and out. Remove and reserve neck, giblets and
  wing tips. Pat dry with paper toweling. Starting at the breast,
  separate the skin from the meat by working your fingers between them.
  Slice your hand under skin as far as you can go and gently free the
  skin on both sides of the breast. Loosen it around the upper part of
  the legs, stopping about halfway down the legs. Insert slices of the
  cold butter, first under the leg skin, then under the breast skin.
  Reshape the loosened skin on the bird by patting it gently back in
  place. It will sag a bit but don't let that upset you; it will cook
  back in place. Wrap bird loosely in waxed paper and refrigerate while
  preparing stuffing.
  4. Fill cavity of turkey loosely with stuffing. (Place any remaining
  stuffing in a shallow baking dish and place in oven about 30 minutes
  before bird is roasted. Bake until firm and lightly browned.) Fasten
  neck skin of turkey to body with skewer. Push legs under band of skin
  at tail or tie to tail. Place slices of salt pork over breast and
  fasten with wooden picks. Place turkey on its side on rack in shallow
  open roasting pan.
  5. Cook for 15 minutes, then turn bird on other side and roast for 15
  minutes longer.
  6. Lower temperature to 325'F. and continue to roast turkey, turning
  the bird from side to side and basting often with the drippings from
  pan, for about 3-1/2 to 4 hours, or until juices run yellow - no
  longer pink - when thigh is pierced with a fork. Roast turkey breast
  side up for the last 15 minutes of cooking time. (Remove and discard
  salt pork when crisp and most of fat has been rendered. If fat in pan
  bgins to burn, add a few tablespoons of water.) Transfer turkey to
  serving platter and let rest 30 minutes before carving. Reserve all
  drippings in pan for gravy.
  
  *** CORN BREAD STUFFING ***
  1. Prepare corn bread, following label directions, or use your own
  favorite recipe. Cool. Crumble enough to make 7 cups and transfer to
  a large mixing bowl.
  2. Saute celery and onion in butter in a large skillet until soft.
  Spoon vegetables and butter over corn bread crumbs.
  3. Beat egg yolks in a medium-sized bowl; stir in stock and pour
  mixture over corn bread. Stir lightly to blend. Season with salt and
  pepper to taste.
  Makes approximately 3 quarts, or 12 cups.
  
  *** TURKEY STOCK ***
  1. Combine giblets, neck, and wing tips with water in a large
  saucepan; add remaining ingredients. Bring to boil, then lower heat
  and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until liver is tender. Remove
  liver and continue to simmer mixture for about 1 hour, or until
  remaining giblets are tender. Strain mixture; remove and chop giblets
  and liver for gravy. Reserve stock.
  
  *** TURKEY GIBLET GRAVY ***
  1. Pour off all turkey fat from roasting pan into a glass measuring
  cup. Measure and return 1/4 cup to pan. Sprinkle flour into fat; cook
  and stir 2 or 3 minutes over low heat. Add water and 2 cups of the
  reserved turkey stock. Cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits in
  pan with wooden spoon, until gravy thickens and bubbles 2 minutes.
  Strain gravy into saucepan; add chopped giblets and reserved liver.
  Taste; season with salt and pepper if needed.

      Title: SMOKED SALMON WITH BROWN SODA BREAD
 Categories: Appetizers, Fish, Holiday, Foreign
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Servings
      3 c  Torn greens (such as red
           -leaf lettuce, frisee and
           -arugula)
      1 lb Thinly sliced smoked salmon
           -(such as Irish, Scottish or
           -Norwegian)
      2 tb Drained capers
      1 sm White onion, thinly sliced
     24    Red cherry tomatoes or pear
           -tomatoes
     24    Yellow pear tomatoes or
           -cherry tomatoes
      2 tb Olive oil (preferably
           -extra-virgin)
 
  A plate of smoked salmon with brown soda bread is a calling card in
  Ireland. In fact, the last thing my mother gave me as I was ending my
  latest visit home was a whole smoked salmon to bring back to the
  States. The greens and olive oil give a modern spin to my version of
  this classic starter.  (Gerri Gilliland, author of article)
  
  Lemon wedges Unsalted butter
  
  Divide greens among plates. Top with salmon. Sprinkle with capers.
  Garnish with onions and tomatoes. Drizzle with oil. Serve with lemon,
  bread and
  
  butter.

 Categories: Seafood, Holiday
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           INGREDIENTS:
      4 c  Firm white bread (Italian or
           -French or sourdough)
    1/2 c  Butter
           Salt and cayenne pepper
      1 pt Raw oysters, well-drained
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 sm Onion, grated
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
 
  paprika (TIP:) This dish can be made with oysters of *any* size. While
  fresh ones ARE best,  thawed, frozen oysters *may*  be used.   If you
  wish, prepare  the dish and refrigerate it for several hours before
  baking.   Or, on  the  other hand,  you can cut and brown the bread
  cubes ahead of  time. The rest can be finished in minutes, once the
  bread is browned.
  
  Remove the crusts from the bread.  Cut the bread into quarter-inch
  cubes; in a large skillet, melt half the butter.  Add 2 cups of bread
  cubes and toss  over LOW HEAT until they're golden-brown.   Sprinkle
  the  cubes lightly with salt and caynne, stirring constantly.
  
  Brown the remaining cubes in the remaining butter.  Sprinkle again
  with the cayenne and the salt.
  
  Cover  the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish with 1/3  of the  bread
  cubes; top the bread evenly with half the oysters,  sprinkle with
  salt and cayenne,  half the lemon juice and half the onion.   Cover
  with 1/3  of the bread  cubes and sprinkle with salt,  cayenne,  the
  rest of the lemon juice and the onion.  Pour in the cream, and top
  with the last third of the bread cubes.  Sprinkle with paprika to
  make pretty.
  
  Bake at 325 degrees for 25 to 35 minutes and serve *immediately*.

      Title: CANDIED ORANGE PEEL
 Categories: Fruits, Holiday
      Yield: 3 servings
 
           INGREDIENTS:
      8    Oranges
           Water
      1 c  Boiling water
      4 c  Sugar
 
  Makes about 3-4 lbs of candy.
  
  (TIP):   Collect  the  orange  halves over a period  of  time  and
  refrigerate  them in a plastic bag until you have enough to prepare
  candied peel.   You may candy *whole* orange halves, if you wish.
   Just boile them without cutting them into strips.  When cooled, they
  make lovely containers for candies and nuts, or holiday desserts.
  
  Wash the oranges.  Cut into halves and squeeze out the juice.  Use the
  juice for some other purpose,  of course.   Place the oranges  into  a
  large saucepan and cover with cold water.
  
  Place over high heat and heat to a boil.   Add cold water to cover
  again. Heat to a boil and drain.   Repeat this process five times in
  all. Drain well and scoop out the pulp.   Cut the oranges into 1/4
  inch  wide strips.
  
  Combine  1 cup of boiling water with 2 cups of the  sugar.    Heat
  until the  sugar is dissolved.   Stir in the orange strips.    Place
  over medium heat  and  boil for about 30  minutes,  until  all  the
  liquid  is evaporated.   Watch carefully so the peels don't scorch.
   Cool.   Roll the strips  in  the remaining 2 cups of sugar.   Place
  on waxed paper  to  dry. Package and store in airtight containers.

      Title: Miniature Cookie Houses
 Categories: Holidays, Non-food, Gifts, Christmas
      Yield: 1 servings
 
MMMMM----------------------FOR COOKIE HOUSE---------------------------
  4 1/2 c  Flour (may need up to 5)
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Margarine; room temperature
      2 c  Sugar
      2 ea Eggs
      2 tb Milk
      2 ts Vanilla extract
           Egg wash

MMMMM-----------------------FOR DECORATING----------------------------
           #5,#7 round and #27 star tip
           Three decorating bags
           Decorating icing
           Colored sugar
           Assorted candies
           Decorating bag with coupler
 
       Make the cookie dough:  Stir or whisk together 4 1/2 cups of the
  flour, the baking powder and salt; set aside. Cream the butter and
  sugar until light; add the eggs, milk, and vanilla and beat well.
  Gradually add the dry ingredients and blend to form a smooth ball of
  dough. If the dough is sticky, add just enough of the remaining flour
  to eliminate the stickiness. The dough should not be dry. Divide the
  dough in half, wrap each ball in plastic and refrigerate for several
  hours, or until firm enough to roll.
       Meanwhile, cut cardboard templates for the base and the three
  parts of the cookie house.  The dimensions are as follows:  THE BASE:
  is a circle 6" across (cut 1)  THE SIDE: is a rectangle 2 3/8" x 3
  1/2" (cut 2) THE FRONT/BACK: is funny shaped. It's 3" wide and 4 1/4"
  tall (total height). From the bottom to the beginning of the "roof"
  section is 2 3/8". At 2 3/8" cut up to form the "roof" top like an
  upside down "V" (cut 2). Finally cut the ROOF: it's a rectangle 2
  3/4" x 4 1/4".
       Preheat oven to 350 degrees. On a flour-dusted cookie sheet or
  the back of one jelly roll pan, roll out one ball of dough to
  1/8"-1/4" thick. For each house cut one base, two sides, two
  front/back pieces, and two roof pieces.  Lay out the cardboard
  patterns on the dough, leaving 1 1/2" between them. The layout will
  depend on the size of your cookie sheet and how many houses you are
  making.  Use a sharp knife to cut around each template, removing
  excess dough as you cut. Wipe the knife frequently. Repeat the
  rolling and cutting process to make the remaining pieces. If you want
  some small trees in front of your house, make them using a cookie
  cutter.
       Bake both sheets of cookies at the same time, for 10-15 minutes
  reemoving pieces when they are done (preferable to overbake than
  underbake since we need firm cookies). The cookies may brown, but
  this is O.K. Transfer immediately to a wire rack to cool completely.
       Decorate the pieces before assembling the houses.  You can do
  this many ways. Mostly use your imagination. Frost or pipe/apply
  candies to the "wet" icing. To "sugar-coat" areas, brush on egg-wash
  (being careful not to touch any piping or decorations); then sprinkle
  immediately with colored sugar. Tap gently to shake off excess sugar.
  Set aside to dry for half an hour.
       Next to assemble houses. Use the #7 icing tip . Pipe a thick
  line of icing along edges to be put together and "glue" the houses
  together and on the base. Make sure to do one area at a time and hold
  until icing sets. Let all set for a few minutes.  When icing is firm,
  do any finishing touches. MAKES THREE COOKIE HOUSES WITH BASES The

      2    Whole vanilla beans
  1 1/2 c  Vodka (the cheap-o stuff
           -works just fine)
    1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Granulated sugar
 
  Anyone interested in a recipe for home-made vanilla extract?  It
  makes a fun gift for Christmas, packaged in a small jar with ribbon
  around neck, included recipe for same, a bag of brownie or cookie mix
  which requires vanilla and a brownie pan.  It IS alcohol-based.
  Perhaps someone has another recipe for one that does not require
  alcohol? Could this be one of those "chemistry" things again?  I
  apologize for typing this in as I still haven't made friends with my
  software but folks who know how to doctor it to adapt to their recipe
  pgm. will find it a tasty and CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP Holiday idea.
  Better start it now, though! It takes about 7 weeks to "steep" it but
  you can fudge a little on that timing, I'm sure.
  
  VANILLA EXTRACT
  
  In a 3 cup glass container with a tight fitting lid, combine vanilla
  beans with the vodka.  Cap and allow to "steep" at room temperature
  for three weeks.  Remove vanilla beans and strain liquid through a
  cheesecloth, if necessary.  In a medium saucepan, combine water and
  sugar, stirring constantly, until it comes to a boil and sugar
  dissolves. Remove from heat and cool.  Stir into vodka that has been
  strained. Pour mixture into a bottle; cap and allow to sit at room
  temperature one month. Yield:2 cups vanilla extract

  I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my b/m for
  the eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what I did; you may
  need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with
  it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too
  dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!
    * Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the
  microwave) Place ingred. in the B/M according to your manufacturers'
  directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as needed This made
  a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of my breadmaker. I
  used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness or darkness
  button slightly lighter than the center mark (I have a Welbilt). Let

      1 tb Salt
      4 c  Flour
 
  Add lard, salt and 2 cups flour to scalded milk and mix well over low
  heat. Remove from fire.  Sift 2 cups of flour on board, add warm
  dough and work in flour.  Knead well and cool. This dough can be
  rolled immediately or kept in a cool place for a couple of days. May
  be stored in a plastic bag. Make a small patty, about hamburger size,
  with even sealed edges as you would for pastry.  Flour board lightly
  and with a Scandinavian rolling pin roll patty in all directions,
  keeping the dough round.  Roll lightly, stretching dough until it is
  almost as large as the lefse baker.  Use pointed stick to handle
  dough when it is transferred from the board to the baker.  Brown
  lightly, prick air bubbles, turn and brown other side.  It may be
  necessary to change heat control from high to low.  This is a soft
  bread.  Serve with butter, or butter and sugar. (Note: I don't have
  either a Scandinavian rolling pin or a lefse baker, so I use a
  regular rolling pin and a griddle.  This is like a Swedish tortilla!
  We usually spread butter and sprinkled sugar over the lefse then
  rolled them up and DEVOURED them!)

  2 1/2 c  Bread flour (or more)
    3/4 c  Warm milk (105F-to-115F)
 
  If you want to give a friend a special holiday gift, put a bright
  ribbon around this bread. When tightly wrapped, it freezes well for 1
  to 2 months.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in warm
  water. Beat 1/2 cup butter in food processor until light. Gradually
  add remainder of sugar as you beat butter. Add lemon and orange
  peels, mace, coriander and salt. Add yeast mixture. Add eggs, 1 at a
  time, beating well after each addition, and then milk. Add enough
  flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make soft dough. Knead dough until
  elastic and smooth. Place dough in oiled plastic bag or oiled bowl
  and turn to coat. Seal or cover with plastic wrap and let rise at
  room temperature until doubled, about 1 hour. Turn out dough on
  floured surface, punch down and cut into 2 pieces. Shape each into
  rectangular loaf and place on greased baking sheet. Melt remaining
  1/4 cup butter and use to lightly brush tops of loaves.
  
  TO PRESENT AS A GIFT: Make paper ribbon strips the width of your gift
  ribbons and tie the bread loosely with the paper strips; secure with
  paper clips, leaving enough room for the breads to rise. The paper
  will leave marks for the position of the gift ribbons. Cover the
  loaves with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled,
  30-to-40 minutes. Bake loaves about 30-to-45 minutes. Remove and
  place on a rack to cool. Remove the paper strips. Replace strips with

      1 ts Milk or water

MMMMM-------------------------DECORATION------------------------------
      7    Halves of glaceed cherries
      7    Walnut or pecan halves

MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/4 ts Almond extract
           Water
 
  This festive bread is perfect for gifts. The recipe can be doubled and
  freezes well for up to 2 months. A fermented yeast "starter" gives
  this bread a full flavor, but you can omit the process if you're in a
  hurry.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. In a food processor or mixer bowl, mix 1 cup of
  the flour, the warm milk, yeast and sugar. If time allows, cover the
  bowl with plastic wrap and leave the dough at room temperature to
  ferment and bubble for 2 hours. If time does not allow, proceed to
  add the egg, salt and butter. Add the rest of the flour, 1/2 cup at a
  time, to make a soft dough. Knead the dough in the food processor,
  mixer or on a floured board until elastic and smooth. Mix the
  cherries, candied fruit, dates and nuts together and fold and knead
  1/3 of the mixture at a time into the dough until well mixed. Place
  in an oiled plastic bag or oiled bowl. Turn to coat. Seal or cover
  and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 3/4 to 1 hour.
  Punch down. Knead briefly. Grease a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Form the
  dough into an oval approximately the length of the pan, and place in
  pan. Let rise again until doubled. Brush the loaves with the egg
  glaze. Bake on the middle shelf about 40-to-50 minutes until nicely
  browned. Cover with foil if the loaf browns too rapidly. Cool on a
  wire rack. TO MAKE ICING, mix confectioners' sugar, oil, almond
  extract and enough water to make a smooth consistency. Brush cooled
  bread with icing. Top with the candied cherries and nuts.

      6 c  Flour,all-purpose
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Butter,melted
 
  1. In a large bowl sprinkle yeast and sugar over warm water (should
  feel comfortably warm when dropped on wrist) and allow to stand until
  bubbly, about 10 minutes.
  2. Combine butter and milk in top of double boiler over simmering
  water until butter has melted and milk is warm. Add to yeast mixture
  and stir until blended. Mix in 2 cups of the flour, 1 cup at a time,
  and beat well to form a spongy dough. Cover and let rise in a warm
  place until double in bulk, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Stir down with
  wooden spoon, then add about 3 more cups of flour to form a moist
  dough that is firm enough to turn out onto a well-floured board.
  3. Dip hands in flour and knead dough until smooth and nonsticky,
  adding additional flour as needed. The dough should be
  velvety-smooth.
  4. Form into a ball and place in a well-buttered, warm mixing bowl.
  Turn ball of dough so that entire surface of dough is coated with
  softened butter. Cover and again place in a warm place until double
  in bulk, about 1 hour.
  5. Punch dough down, turn out onto a lightly floured board, and let
  rest for about 5 minutes.
  6. Roll out to a thickness of about 1/2 inch cut with a floured knife
  first into approximate 2-inch squares, then into triangles. Roll up
  from wide side to point and place on baking sheet about 1/4 inch
  apart. When all are prepared, brush with melted butter and again let
  rise until about double in bulk, about 30 minutes.
  7. Bake in a preheated 350'F. oven until lightly browned, 25 to 30
  minutes, depending on size. To test for doneness gently tap top of
  roll for a hollow sound or break open one roll to see if it is
  sufficiently baked in the center.

      2 tb Sugar
 
  Grease the bottom and sides of four 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 1 1/2-inch loaf

  have nicely rounded tops and no unwanted rims around the edges.  Set
  aside.
  
  Stir together 1 cup of the flour, the brown sugar, baking
  
  powder, cinnamon, and baking soda.  Add the pumpkin, molasses, eggs,
  margarine or butter, and gingerroot or ginger.  Beat with an electric
  mixer on low to medium speed until combined, about 30 seconds.  Beat
  on medium to high speed for 2 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl
  occasionally. Add the remaining flour; beat for 2 minutes or until
  mixed. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans.
  
  For the topping, stir together the walnuts and sugar; sprinkle evenly
  over the batter in the pans.  Bake in a 350 F oven for 40 to 50
  minutes or until a wooden pick inserted near the center of each loaf
  comes out clean. Cool the loaves in the pans on wire racks for 10
  minutes. Remove the loaves from the pans.  Cool thoroughly on the
  wire racks.
  
  To Freeze:  Wrap each loaf tightly in moisture- and vaporproof wrap.
  Seal, label, and freeze for up to 6 months.  To thaw, let stand,
  loosely covered, at room temperature for 1 hour.  Or, to micro-thaw,
  place 1 unwrapped loaf on a microwave-safe paper towel.  Microcook,
  uncovered, at 30% power (medium-low) for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.
  
  Makes 4 loaves, 8 servings each.

      Title: Christmas Stollen From Brigitte Sealing
 Categories: Cyberealm, Breads, Christmas
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  1 1/8 lb Flour
      7 oz Sugar
      1 pn Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Lemon juice
      4 tb Rum
      1 pn Cardomom (generous)
      1 pn Mace (generous)
      2    Eggs
  4 1/2 oz Butter
  4 1/2 oz Currants well drained
      9 oz Sultanas
      9 oz Almonds, finely chopped
  3 1/2 oz Candied lemon peel
  1 3/4 oz Butter for brushing
      2 tb Powdered sugar for dusting
  1 3/4 oz Beef drippings
      9 oz Cottage cheese, well drained
 
  Mix and sieve together the flour and baking powder onto a pastry
  board or cool slab. Make a well in the center and pour in the sugar,
  vanilla, rum, lemon juice, and the eggs. Draw in some flour from the
  sides of the well to mix with these and form a thick paste. Add the
  cold butter, cut into small pieces, the finely chopped beef
  drippings, cottage cheese, currants, sultanas, nuts and candied peel.
  Cover the fruits with more of the flour, and then starting from the
  middle, work all of it together quickly with your hands into a firm,
  smooth paste. If it should stick, add a little more flour. Form the
  mix into a long, oval shape, and then fold it over lengthwise to give
  it the traditional "stollen" shape.
  
  Line a baking dish with greased waxed paper and place stollen on this.
  
  Preheat the oven for 5 minutes at 500F. Then bake at a moderately hot
  over (375F) for 50-60 minutes. As soon as the stollen comes out of
  the oven, brush with melted butter and dust thickly with powdered
  sugar.

      2 ts Soy sauce
      1 tb Rice wine or sake
  1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
  1 1/2 tb Minced fresh ginger
  1 1/2 tb Minced scallions
      1    Egg white, lightly beaten
  1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
           TO ASSEMBLE:
     48    Wonton skins
           Cornstarch for dusting
           TO FINISH:
      4 c  Homemade chicken broth
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
     10 oz Fresh spinach, stems
           -removed, rinsed and drained
 
  FILLING:
  
  Place the shrimp in a linen dish towel or on paper towels and squeeze
  out as much moisture as possible.  Chop the shrimp to a paste in a
  food processor fited with a steel blade or by hand.  Place the water
  chestnuts in a towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.
  Place the shrimp paste, water chestnuts, soy sauce, rice wine, sesame
  oil, salt, pepper, ginger, scallions and egg white in a mixing bowl.
  Using your hand or a spoon, stir vigorously in one direction to
  combine the ingredients evenly. Add the cornstarch and stir to blend.
  The mixture should be stiff.
  
  Use a fork, teaspoon or two chopsticks to place a scant teaspoonful
  of the filling in the center of each wonton skin.  Gather the edges
  of the skin together around the filling and squeeze to form a "waist"
  as you gradually remove the fork, teaspoon or chopsticks.  Squeeze
  the "waist" and the ends shut to enclose the filling.  The finished
  dumpling should look like a drawstring purse.  Place the finished
  dumplings on a tray that has been lightly dusted with cornstarch.
  
  Heat 3 quarts of water to boiling in a large pot.  Add the wontons and
  cover.  Once the water is boiling again, cook for about 4 minutes or
  until they rise to the surface.  Remove with a long-handled strainer
  and drain. Discard the water.  Heat the chicken stock, salt and
  sesame to boiling. Add the spinach and cooked wontons and portion
  into serving bowls. Serve.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

           -peeled & grated in long,
           -thin shreds
    1/2 c  Celery; finely diced
    1/4 c  Butter; melted
      4 c  Milk; or 1/2 milk, 1/2 cream
      4 c  Oysters

  Peel and grate in long thin shreads, the carrots and add finely diced
  celery. Melt butter in saucepan and add the vegetables. Stir. Cover
  and simmer over very low heat for 20 minutes, without browning the
  vegetables. Add milk (or use 1/2 milk, 1/2 cream); bring to a boil.
  Heat oysters in enamelled cast iron pan over medium heat; do not
  boil. Pour into milk and serve. Uase salt and pepper to taste.
  
  The soup should be served as soon as ready, otherwise it tend to
  curdle. The milk and vegetables can be be prepared ahead of time and
  the oysters heated and served at the last minute.
  
  To quote Mme. Benoit,"This traditional Quebec dish is still very much
  alive.  My grandmother's recipe is, as far as I am concerned, the best
  there is." Note: from Anne - it seems as oysters were used at
  Christmas. My maternal grandmother from the American midwest had a
  similar Christmas oyster dish although hers included corn.

    1/2 ts Mace
    1/8 ts Allspice
    1/4 ts Black Pepper; Freshly Ground
      3 c  Seedless Raisins
      3 c  White Or Golden Raisins
    1/2 c  Almonds; Ground
  1 1/2 c  Almonds; Coarsely Chopped
      3    Eggs; Lg
    1/2 c  Buttermilk or Milk
      1 c  Brandy
      1    Egg;Lg, Beaten
 
  *    The butter, 3 sticks, should be cut into small pieces.
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  +++
  
  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the butter, 3 3/4 c flour, and
  1/4 ts of salt.  With your fingers, work the ingredients together
  until you form small granules that are fairly uniform in size.
  Sprinkle 8 tb of the ice water over the granules and continue mixing
  until you can gather the ingredients into a ball.  If the dough
  crumbles, add additional ice water, 1 tb at a time, until a soft ball
  can be formed.  With the flat of your hand, press the dough into a
  thick cake, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1
  hour.  Prepare the filling by sifting the 3 1/2 cups of flour, the
  sugar, baking powder, spices, and remaining 1/4 ts of salt into a
  large bowl.  Add the freshly ground black pepper, seedless and white
  or golden raisins, ground and coarsely chopped almonds.  Mix
  thoroughly until all the fruits and nuts are coated well with the dry
  ingredients.  Add the 3 eggs, milk, and brandy mixing well.  Preheat
  the oven to 375 degrees F. and, on a lightly floured surface, roll
  two-thirds of the chilled pastry to a thickness of 1/4-inch.  Gently
  place a 9 X 3 1/2-inch springform pan on the pastry.  With a small
  sharp knife,cut along the outside of the pan to make a disk.  Line
  the bottom of the pan with the disk of pastry.  Use the remaining
  pieces of rolled-out pasty to line the sides of the pan, slightly
  overlapping the pastry on the bottom and letting the pastry extend
  about 1/2-inch above the top of the form.  Spoon the filling into the
  pan, packing it down firmly and press the excess pastry over the
  filling.  Brush the pastry with a little of the beaten egg. In the
  same fashion, roll out the remaining pastry into a circle larger than
  the form.  Roll the pastry around the rolling pin to lift it and
  unroll it on the top of the form.  Press the top pastry against the
  filling and the pastry below to make a tight seal and trim off the
  excess. Brush the entire top with the beaten egg.  Cut a 1-inch round
  vent in the middle of the bun, and if you like, use the pastry scraps
  to make leaves. Roll the scraps together and cut out tear drop shapes
  to resemble leaves. Score the top, with a small sharp knife, to
  resemble the ribs of the leaves. Brush the undersides of the leaves
  with the remaining beaten egg to make them adhere to the top of the
  bun.  Then brush the top again with the beaten egg. Bake on a rack in
  the middle of the oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the pastry is a
  rich golden brown.  If the decorations color much faster than the top
  sheath of pasty, cover them with aluminum foil to reflect the oven
  heat and retard the browning.

      3 tb Unsalted butter
  1 1/2 tb Bourbon
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F 15 minutes before baking, with the rack in the
  center of the oven. Butter a 6-cup souffle dish. Have a kettle of
  boiling water ready and a baking pan large enough to hold the souffle
  dish. Whisk the eggs, egg yolk and sugar until light. Mix in the
  butter, the half-and-half, brandy, vanilla, nutmeg and salt. Place
  the bread in the souffle dish and pour the custard over it. Press the
  bread into the custard so it gets well soaked. Let rest 20 minutes.
  Put the souffle dish in the baking pan and place on the oven rack.
  Pour boiling water into the baking pan so it comes halfway up the
  sides of the souffle dish. Bake until the custard is softly set in
  the center, about 1 hour. Remove from the water bath. Serve warm or
  at room temperature with Cranberry-Maple Sauce. Once cooled, the
  pudding can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. To reheat, cover with
  aluminum foil with several slits in it. Bake in a preheated 350F oven

  and cook until their skins burst and they begin to pop, 6 to 8
  minutes, or slightly longer if they are frozen. Cut the butter into 3
  pieces. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the butter, 1 piece
  at a time, waiting until each is incorporated before adding another.
  Add the bourbon. Sauce can be served immediately or refrigerated for
  up to a week. Reheat gently and thin with 2 to 3 tablespoons water
  before serving.

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
      2 oz Golden raisins
      2 tb Breadcrumbs
      4 tb Butter
      4 oz Walnut meats
      1 oz Blanched almonds
      1 oz Candied citron
      1 oz Candied orange peel
      2 oz Pine nuts
      1    Lemon; grated peel only
      1    Orange; grated peel only
      2    Egg yolks
      1    Egg white
           Granulated sugar
 
  One of Italy's very special Christmas and New Year's dishes is this
  rich nut-and-fruit pastry, sometimes spelled "Putitza" or "Putizza."
  
  DISSOLVE THE YEAST in 1/4 cup milk. Add 1/2 cup flour and knead into
  a soft ball. Cover this with a towel and let it rise in a warm place.
  When it has doubled in bulk, add it to a bowl containing the rest of
  the flour, the sugar, eggs, melted butter, pinch of salt and grated
  lemon peel. Mix in enough milk to make a supple dough; knead well.
  Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in bulk. Put the
  raisins in a small bowl and cover with hot water; let soften, then
  drain.
  
  Saute breadcrumbs in 3 tablespoons butter. Finely chop walnuts,
  almonds and candied fruits. In a large bowl, mix together the
  raisins, pignoli, grated lemon and orange peel, chopped nuts and
  fruits, sauteed breadcrumbs and 1 egg yolk. Whip the egg white into
  soft peaks and fold it into the mixture. Preheat oven to 375F. Butter
  a baking sheet. Roll dough into a sheet 1/8-inch thick. Spread
  filling over it, leaving 1 inch clear at the edges. Roll it into a
  cylinder and coil it on the baking sheet like a snail shell. Beat the
  remaining egg yolk in a small bowl and paint the surface of the dough
  with it. Sprinkle it with sugar and bake 35 to 40 minutes, or until
  pastry is firm and golden brown.

  long. Cut the ropes into 1" pieces.  Toss the pieces with enough
  flour to dust them lightly and shake off excess flour. Heat oil to
  375F in a deep fryer. Fry the struffoli a few handfuls at a time
  until they puff up and are golden brown. Using a slotted spoon,
  transfer to a paper towel to drain. Combine the honey and the 1/2

 Categories: Cakes, American, Beverages, Holiday
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Bourbon
    1/4 c  Butter; softened
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      5    Eggs
      4 c  Flour; sifted
      2 ts Baking powder

      1 pn Salt
      1 ts Lemon zest; grated
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 c  Pecans; chopped
 
  Marinate raisins in 1 cup of the bourbon for at least 1 hour, up to 12
  hours; drain, reserving both raisins and bourbon. Preheat oven to 350
  degrees. Butter and flour a 10-inch Bundt cake pan or other tube-cake
  pan. Beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. (For
  best results, use an electric mixer and start beating at a slow
  speed, gradually increasing to moderate. If you allow this process to
  take about 15 minutes, the butter will be very pale and look
  something like whipped cream. This adds lightness to the cake.) Beat
  in the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each. In another bowl,
  sift together 3 3/4 cups of the flour, baking powder, soda and salt.
  Combine reserved bourbon with the zest and lemon juice. Add dry
  ingredients to the butter mixture alternatelywith the bourbon
  mixture. Toss the remaining 1/4 cup of flour with the drained raisins
  and the pecans. Fold into batter. Bake about 11/2 hours or until the
  cake tests done. Cool about 10 minutes in the pan before turninout
  onto a rack. Brush the remaining 1/2 cup of bourbon over the cake
  whileit is still somewhat warm. For long storage, wrap the cake in
  rinsed cheesecloth that has been thoroughly moistened in bourbon.
  Then wrap in plastic or foil so that it is airtight.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
           INGREDIENTS:
      1 c  Pumpkin
    1/4 c  Honey
    3/4 ts Cinnamon
      5    Eggs
      1 cn (13 oz.) Carnation

      1 tb Brandy (or Asbach-Uralt),
           -optional
    1/4 c  Brown sugar, packed
 
  (TIP:) Six individual custard cups can be used as well as the form in
  the main recipe section.   Bake them at 325 degrees for 45 minutes,
  and test with a knife at the edge of the custard.   The center will
  continue to cook when  removed  from the oven because of the small
  size.    Cover  and chill.  For a pumpkin flan "brulee" sprinkle the
  brown sugar over the BAKED custard (rather than in the bottom of the
  cup)  and broil 4 inches from the heat  until the  sugar  bubbles,
  watching every second....it  burns *very* easily.  When the sugar
  bubbles, remove it immediately, cover and chill.
  
  Combine  the pumpkin,  honey and cinnamon.   Beat the eggs.    Add
  milk, vanilla and pumpkin mixture to the eggs.  Stir in the brandy,
  mixing well.
  
  Sprinkle  the  brown sugar over the BOTTOM of a  buttered  10-inch
  baking dish.  S-l-o-w-l-y  pour in the custard mixture and place the
  baking dish in a pan of hot water.   Bake (together with the pan of
  hot water)  at 350 degrees for one hour, or until the custard is set.
  Insert a knife into the custard.  If it comes out clean, the custard
  is done.   Cover and chill for 2 to 4 hours before serving.

      Title: Fudge a la Louise
 Categories: Candies, Chocolate, Christmas
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Sugar
      3    Squares dark baking
           -chocolate
  1 1/3 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter, plus extra for
           -greasing platters
      1 c  Chopped nuts
  1 1/3 ts Vanilla
 
  In a heavy saucepan mix together the sugar, chocolate, and milk.
  Place the pan over high heat and stir constantly until the choclate
  is melted and the sugar is dissolved. Bring to a full boil, and lower
  the heat so the candy continues to boil gently, not vigorously. Stir
  no more. Put a candy thermometer into the center of the mixture and
  cook until the temperature reaches exactly 232 F. Meanwhile, butter a
  large platter (turkey size) and a flat pan about 11 by 13 inches.
  When the fudge reaches 232 F., pour it into the readied platter - do
  not scrape the pan, but let it drip out. Dot with 2 tablespoons
  butter and let the mixture cool until the platter feels cool
  underneath. Add vanilla. Take a large slotted spoon and start to stir
  the liquidy mixture - it will take about 15 or 20 minutes. You will
  see a steady change from dark to light color, from glossy to dull,
  from liquid to solid. When the fudge begins to get dull, add the nuts
  and mix in thoroughly. Put fudge into the large buttered pan and
  press into shape with the flat of your palms. Cut into squares; store
  in airtight container if there's any left.

      1 lb Powdered sugar, unsifted
           -(about 3-1/4 cups)
     36    Walnut pieces
 
  Fudge gets texture from potato: potatoes cooked in the microwave oven
  give this fudge its unbelievably creamy, fudgey texture.  The mellow
  flavor comes from Irish Crem liqueur, used in both the fudge and the
  icing. Use a pastry bag to pipe the icing or a spoon to drizzle it
  onto the fudge. The added bonux is that this fudge is low in fat.
  
  Designer Icing (recipe follows)
  
  Line an 8x8x2-inch pan with foil. extending foil over the edges of
  the pan. Butter foil; set the pan aside.  Prick potato 2 or 3 times
  witha fork. Cook on 100% power (High) for 4-5 minute sor until
  tender, turning over once. Cool and peel.  Mash potato (you should
  have 1/3 cup).  Add liqueur, stir until smooth.  Set aside.
  
  In a 2-quart microwave-save casserole combine chocolate and margarine;
  cook, uncovered, on High for 1-2 minutes or until almost melted,
  stirring once.  Stir until smooth.
  
  Stir potato mixture into chocolate mixture.  Slowly stir in powdered
  sugar. Stir or knead until smooth.  Press into the foil-lined pan.
  Score into thirty-six 1-1/4-inch squares.  Press a walnut piece into
  each square. Cover and chill until firm.  Holding foil at edges,
  remove the fudge from the pan; cut into squares.  Drizzle Designer
  icing over fudge.
  
  ~=>Designer Icing In a small microwave-save bowl, cook 1 Tbsp
  margarine/butter on High for 45 seconds or until melted. Beat in 1/3
  cup sifted powdered sugar and enough Irish Creme liqueur (1-2 Tbsp)
  to ake an icing of piping or drizzling consistency.

      Title: Truffes Au Chocolat (Chocolate Truffles)
 Categories: Chocolate, Candies, Christmas
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 oz Chocolate
  1 1/2 oz Butter
      2 oz Powdered sugar
      2 tb Fresh cream
 
  Preparation: Put cream, butter and grated chocolate into a pan. The
  chocolate need not be grated fine. The cream can be replaced by
  skimming the top off raw milk poured into a wide basin and allowed to
  settle. Melt butter, chocolate, and cream in a double boiler,
  stirring to mix well. When melted, remove the double boiler from the
  fire, leaving the hot water in the bottom pan to keep it warm. Sift
  the powdered sugar in slowly, so that it will not form lumps,
  stirring constantly. Let stand 24 hr. in a cool place. (In winter, 12
  hr. in a cold room will do.) At the end of this time, cut a piece of
  this chocolate about the size of a small nut, using a knife or spoon.
  Roll it into a ball in the palm of the hand until the outside of the
  bonbon begins to melt a little. Then roll it in grated or granulated
  chocolate, which will stick to it perfectly. Let stand 2 hr. before
  serving, but in a place that is not too cold, because these truffles
  are better when they are a little soft. Instead of rolling them into
  balls, you can also shape them to look more like truffles.

      Title: Truffes Pralinees (Praline Truffles)
 Categories: Chocolate, Candies, Christmas
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 lb Good chocolate
           About 1/2 glass water
      3    Egg yolks
      3 oz Butter
  1 1/2 oz Praline paste
 
  Slowly melt the chocolate in the water, bring to a gentle boil,
  remove from the fire, and add the yolks, beating with a spatula, then
  replace on a low fire to poach the eggs in the chocolate. Do not stop
  beating. Remove from the fire and add the butter and the praline
  paste. Let cool, beating from time to time (this cooling takes a
  rather long time). When the mixture begins to solidify, take some
  with a spoon, place it in some grated chocolate (prepared in
  advance), and shape to resemble real truffles. These truffles keep a
  week. To keep a longer time, substitute vegetable shortening for the
  butter.

      3 c  Vanilla wafer crumbs
    1/2 c  Finely chopped pecans
    1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa
      2 c  Confectioner's sugar
    1/2 c  Bourbon
      3 tb Light corn syrup
           Salt, if desired
 
  1.  Blend together the crumbs, nuts, cocoa, 1 cup confectioner's
  sugar, bourbon, corn syrup, and a dash of salt.  Form into small
  balls the size of walnuts.
  
  2.  Roll each ball in the remaining 1 cup confectioner's sugar and
  place on a cookie sheet.  Chill in the refrigerator for several hours
  or overnight.
  
  Note:  It is traditional in the South to use bourbon, but rye may
  also be used. This confection -- or at least a version of it -- was
  an early Southern version of those chocolate truffles that became the
  rage for chocolate lovers during the 1980s in this country. The
  whiskey balls are made, of course, with cocoa rather than chocolate.

      Title: White Chocolate-Coffee Truffles
 Categories: Candies, Christmas
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    3/4 c  Whipping cream
      1 tb Instant espresso or coffee
           -powder
     14 oz White chocolate, very finely
           -chopped
      2 tb Kahlua
           Dipping chocolate:
      1 lb White chocolate, very finely
           -chopped
      2 ts Vegetable oil
      3 tb Chocolate-covered coffee
           -beans, very finely chopped
 
  1. To make the truffles: In a medium saucepan, bring the cream and
  espresso powder to a boil.  pour over the chocolate and whisk until
  completely melted.  whisk in the Kahlua. Refrigerate until completely
  chilled and firm.
  
  2. With a tsp, place pieces of the chocolate onto a foil-lined baking
  sheet.  Refrigerate to firm; roll into balls and refrigerate again for
  about 30 minutes.
  
  3. To prepare the dipping chocolate: In the top of a double boiler
  set over hot water, place the chocolate and oil. stir until almost
  melted. Remove the top of the double boiler from the heat and stir
  until the chocolate has completely melted.  continue to stir until
  the chocolate has cooled and reaches a temperature of 90 degrees.
  
  4. Prepare 2 baking sheets by lining with aluminum foil.  Dip each
  candy center in the melted chocolate, shake off the excess and place
  on the baking sheet.  When you have dipped a row of candies, top each
  with a little of the chocolate- covered coffee bean.  Before each
  dipping, stir the chocolate vigorously with your fingers.  If the
  centers become too soft, chill for about 30 minutes.
  
  5. Let the candies set for about 2 hours before storing in
  refrigeration. If the centers start to come through the bottoms of
  the chocolates, as often happens with soft mixtures, dip the bottoms
  again in melted and cooled chocolate.

      1    Pie dough (double batch)
    1/4 c  Cheddar cheese-grated
     12    Apples; medium- peeled &
           -cored
    1/2 c  Mincement
    1/4 c  Rum
           Butter
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Sugar; Brown
    1/4 c  Cream
           Lemon rind; 1/2 lemon
 
  Preheat oven to 400F. Make enough pie enough to roll into 12 6"x6"
  squares (about a double batch.) Sprinkle each square with 1 tsp
  grated cheddar. Peel and core apples and place one on each square.
  Fill the centre of each apple with 2 tsp (or 1 heaping tsp) of
  mincement, 1 tsp of rum, a dot of butter and 1 Tablespoon sugar.
  Bring diagonally opposite corners of dough over the apple to form
  ears at the top. Cover the 'ears' with aluminium foil. Mix the brown
  sugar, cream and grated lemon rind. Brush the dumplings with this
  mixture and bake 35 to 45 minutes in 400F oven.Remove foil, brush
  ears with cream mixture and return to oven till 'ears' are brown.
  Serve warm to plain cream or sweetened cream, flavoured with rum.
  
  Note from Anne MacLellan: Mme Benoit does not give total amounts for
  cheese, sugar, mincement and rum. I used Meal Master's conversion to
  decimal and back to calculate the total amounts.
  
  To quote Mme. Benoit,"In Quebec these were baked in deep brown
  earthenware pudding dishes and served on a hot wooden board or tray
  surrounded by autumn leaves or boughs cut from the Christmas tree. It
  was a traditional in our family to serve these dumplings after we had
  finished decorating the Christmas tree."

      Title: Mary Litchfield Grimwood's 1890 English Plum Puddings
 Categories: Christmas, Desserts, Fruits, Harned 1994, Nuts
      Yield: 6 puddings
 
  4 1/2 c  All-purpose flour*; sifted
      4 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Cloves
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
      1    Box muscat raisins; seeded
      1    Box seedless nectar raisins
           -- (golden raisins)
           -or-
      1    Box sultanas
      1    Box currants
      2 c  Finely chopped apples
  1 1/2 c  Chopped black walnuts and
           -pecans; mixed
      1 lb Good beef suet
           -- ground by butcher
      2 c  Light brown sugar
      6    Eggs; well beaten
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
      1 c  Soft fresh bread crumbs
           -- from homemade-type bread
 
  *Plus additional flour for dusting fruits and adding to batter if
  needed.
  
  Grease and flour six 1-pound coffee cans or pudding molds.
  
  Sift the 4 1/2 cups flour with next 7 dry ingredients into a large
  bowl. In a separate bowl, dust the raisins, currants, apples and nuts
  with 2 tablespoons additional flour.
  
  Mix together the suet, brown sugar, eggs and buttermilk.  Add the suet
  mixture gradually to the sifted dry ingredients, mixing well.  Add
  fruits and bread crumbs; mix until well-blended.  (If batter is not
  stiff, stir in additional flour as needed.)
  
  Divide mixture among prepared cans or molds, filling them half full.
  Cover each with a double sheet of waxed paper and tie down securely.
  
  Pressure cooker: Place hot water in the bottom of a large pressure
  cooker/canner, using enough to reach a level just below the bottom of
  a steaming rack.  Place cans or molds on the rack.  Cover the pressure
  canner and steam the puddings 20 minutes with the vent tube (or
  petcock) open.  Then attach the automatic pressure control or close
  the petcock and cook for 50 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure.  Remove the
  pressure cooker from heat.  When pressure is completely reduced, open
  and remove the puddings from the cooker.
  
  Regular steamer: In a large stockpot or boiling water bath canner, add
  water to come up just below the bottom of the steaming rack.  Add
  puddings, cover and steam for 6 hours, adding water as necessary to
  keep from boiling dry.  It helps if the lid is tightfitting; if not,
  try putting a weight on the lid to keep it down, or cover the pot rim
  with a strip of aluminum foil to help the lid fit more tightly.
  
  To serve, slice and resteam in the top of a double boiler over
  simmering water until hot, about 1 hour.  Serve with hard sauce and
  whipped cream flavored with brandy or the Wilson family's favorite
  sauce (see recipe).
  
  This pudding will keep for months in the refrigerator or may be
  frozen up to one year.

      2 c  Currants (1/2 pound)
           -- loosely packed
  1 1/2 c  Golden and/or muscat raisins
           -- (1/2 pound)

           -crumbs
           -- from homemade-type bread
    1/2 c  Dry cocktail sherry
      6    Egg yolks; well beaten
      6    Egg whites; beaten stiff
           -- but not dry

MMMMM-------------------------FOR MOLDS------------------------------
      3    To 4 tb. soft butter
           Brown sugar or flour
           Candied red cherries (opt.)
           -- for bottom of molds
           Additional brandy or other
           -liquor
           -- for ripening pudding

MMMMM-------------------------HARD SAUCE------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter; softened
  2 1/2 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
      1 tb Brandy
           Few drops cream; if needed

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Holly sprigs
           Candied fruit or angelica
           Brandy
 
  Combine the dried fruits and peels in a large bowl and sprinkle with
  cognac.  Cover and place in the refrigerator overnight (or longer - in
  which case you may want to add more cognac).
  
  To the fruits in the large bowl, add nuts and suet.  Resift flour
  with the baking soda, salt and spices; then sift over the fruit
  mixture while tossing and mixing with a wooden spoon to evenly
  distribute the dry ingredients.  Stir in jam and brown sugar.
  
  Prepare the bread crumbs (use the food processor, removing crusts
  first if they are crusty and hard).  Sprinkle bread crumbs into the
  sherry, mixing with a fork.  Add to the fruit mixture.
  
  Add the beaten egg yolks; mix thoroughly.  Last, fold in beaten egg
  whites.
  
  Prepare two pudding molds.  This recipe makes enough for one 2-quart
  mold, and the remainder can be steamed in a coffee can - a 26-ounce
  can makes a round pudding about 3" tall.  (You could make one huge
  pudding if you have a container.)
  
  Grease molds with butter and then sprinkle them with sugar or dust
  with flour.  Arrange candied cherries in molds, if desired (cherries
  should be dusted with flour).  Fill 2-quart mold no more than 2/3
  full with batter. Cover pudding mold with its lid, fasten with clamps
  or tie on securely.
  
  For the coffee can, cover with its plastic lid, tie it on and wrap all
  with aluminum foil.  (The plastic will split.)  For a bowl without a
  lid, cover the top with layered waxed paper tied down securely, then
  do the same with aluminum foil.

  To steam the puddings:  Place each pudding in its own steaming
  container on a rack placed over gently boiling water (see note).
  Cover each kettle with a tight-fitting lid and steam puddings - 7
  hours for pudding in a 2-quart mold (6" tall, 7" across the top)
  filled 2/3 full; 6 hours for the smaller one.  Check the water level
  every hour or so, replenishing with boiling water as needed.
  
  When the pudding has finished steaming, uncover it and let it cool.
  Remove the pudding from the mold, if it is metal, and sprinkle 2 tb.
  or so of brandy, sherry, rum or fruit juice over the pudding.  Wrap
  it in clean, unbleached muslin, then wrap it in foil and store it in
  the refrigerator to ripen for at least three weeks.  Open from time
  to time and sprinkle judiciously with more liquor - or add it to the
  pudding cloth.
  
  When ready to serve, return to the pudding mold and steam as before
  for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  To serve: Place hot pudding on a warmed platter.  Place a sprig of
  holly in the center and decorate sparingly with candied fruit or
  angelica. Carefully warm several tablespoons of brandy, and pour a
  bit at the rim of the platter.  Ignite brandy with a long-stemmed
  match and carry flaming to the table.  Serve with hard sauce and/or
  brandy-flavored whipped cream.
  
  Yield: Each pudding serves 10 or more.  Makes 5 pounds of pudding or
  more.
  
  Note: The bottom of the pudding mold should be above the gently
  boiling water at all times so that the pudding is cooked by steam. It
  may take some ingenuity to find a way to raise the pudding above the
  water.
  
  Kluger wrote: "I steamed one pudding in a vegetable blancher, placing
  my canning funnel upside down in the perforated basket and placing the
  pudding mold on top of that.  The second 'steamer' was contrived by
  placing a flat-bottomed colander upside down in the bottom of a
  hot-water-bath kettle. This made a nice platform for the pudding to
  stand on - about 2" above the bottom of the pan.  Allow ample space
  between the pudding and the sides of the kettle so the steam can
  circulate."
  
  Note: If you want to freeze one of the puddings, cool it after
  steaming. Wrap in moisture-vapor-proof freezer wrap and store at 0 F.
  for up to 1 year.  When ready to eat, unwrap and thaw loosely covered
  in the refrigerator.  Then return to the pudding mold and steam as
  directed above for serving.
  
  To make hard sauce:  Using the small bowl of an electric mixer, beat
  the butter until creamy.  Add confectioners' sugar gradually, beating
  until mixture is creamy, about 5 minutes.  Add the brandy.
  
  Press hard sauce through a pastry bag to form decorative shapes and
  decorate them with candied red cherry halves and green fruit peels.
  (If the mixture is too soft, place in refrigerator to stiffen.)

  heat while spooning out. If you have never tasted freshly made
  pralines, made from fresh Louisiana pecans, you have just never

 Categories: Dessert, Canned, Chocolate
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    CANNING JARS, wide mouth
      1 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
      1 c  SUGAR
    1/2 ts BAKING SODA
    1/4 ts GROUND CINNAMON (optional)
    1/3 c  BUTTER;or MARGARINE
    1/4 c  WATER
      3 tb UNSWEETENED COCOA POWDER
    1/4 c  BUTTERMILK
      1    EGG; beaten
    1/2 ts VANILLA EXTRACT
    1/4 c  WALNUTS; finely chopped
 
  Here's one you can start out with, it makes 2 jars. Every recipe
  technique is the same, just different ingredients.. Sterilize, two
  1-pint straight-sided wide-mouth canning jars (specifically made for
  canning jams and jellies) lids and rings by boiling for 10 minutes
  (keep the lids and rings in the hot water until ready to use); set
  aside. In a small bowl stir together flour, sugar, baking soda and
  cinnamon, if desired. Set aside. In a medium saucepan combine butter
  or margarine, water and cocoa powder; heat and stir until butter or
  margarine is melted and mixture is well blended. Remove from heat;
  stir in flour mixture. Add buttermilk, egg and vanilla; beat by hand
  until smooth. Stir in nuts. Pour mixture into the prepared canning
  jars; place jars onto a cookie sheet. Preheat oven to 325-degrees.
  Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a pick inserted deep into each cake
  comes out clean. Remove cakes from the oven, one at a time. Place a
  lid, then a ring onto the jars and screw down tightly. USE HEAVY-DUTY
  MITTS, the jars ARE HOT!! Place jars onto your counter to cool.
  You'll hear a "plinking" sound. If you miss the sound, wait until the
  cakes are cool and press on the lids, they shouldn't move at all,
  that means they've sealed. Store cakes in a cool, dark place. They
  should last up
  
  to a year--I don't know, they've never lasted that long around here!
  If you'd like to decorate them, place a wad of cotton in the center
  of each lid, then place a piece of decorative cloth, about 3-inches
  larger in circumference than the lid, (cut with pinking shears) on
  top of the cotton. Screw the ring back on (by this time the rings can
  be removed as the lids should be sealed). Use your imagination when
  decorating--a hot glue gun works wonders (dried flowers, ribbon,
  etc). These make WONDERFUL Christmas gifts. Ellie

  heat and stir in the chocolate and 1 stick of butter. When the
  chocolate and butter have completely melted, whisk the mixture to
  combine completely. Whisk in the beaten eggs. Pour about half the
  chocolate mixture into the dry ingredients and whisk vigorously to
  thoroughly combine the ingredients and remove any lumps. Working
  quickly, add the remaining chocolate mixture and whisk to combine.
  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 60 minutes,
  until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the
  cake cool in the pan for about 15 minutes, then turn out onto a rack
  to cool completely. In a medium bowl, cream together the remaining 3
  sticks of butter and the confectioners' sugar, until light and
  fluffy. Remove 1/3 cup of the icing, place in a small bowl, and color
  it with a few drops of the green food coloring. Put the remaining
  icing in a pot, add the vanilla. Over low heat, stir the icing until
  it becomes a pourable consistency. (If it overheats, causing the
  butter to spearate, put the icing in the refrigerator to chill and
  stir to bring it back together.) Pour the icing over the cooled cake
  so that it drips down the center and outside. Cluster the red berries
  in groups of 3 on top of the cake. Fill the green icing into a pastry
  bag fitted with a leaf tip and pipe a few leaves around each cluster
  of berries. Serves 12 to 16. Source:"An Edible Christmas" (A Treasury

      Title: Sour Cream Coffee Cake W/ Chocolate & Walnuts
 Categories: Cakes, Entertain
      Yield: 12 servings
 
           -Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
      1 c  (2 sticks) unsalted butter;
           -softened
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Baking powder
      3    Large eggs
      1 c  Sour cream
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
      4 oz Bittersweet chocolate;
           -coarsely chopped
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 10-to 12-cup fluted
  tube pan. In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at
  high speed, beat the butter until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the
  sugar and continue beating at high speed until light and creamy,
  about 2 minutes. Sift together the flour, salt, baking soda, and
  baking powder. At low speed, beat in 1/2 cup of the flour mixture,
  then beat in 1 of the eggs. Beat in another 1/2 cup of the flour
  mixture, then 1 of the remaining eggs. Repeat with another 1/2 cup of
  the flour mixture, and the last egg. Beat in the remaining flour
  along with the sour cream and vanilla. Using a spatula, fold in the
  walnuts and chocolate. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and
  smooth the surface. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes in the preheated oven
  until the cake begins to shrink from the sides of the pan and a
  toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The surface will
  crack. Remove the cake from the oven and let cool for about 10
  minutes in the pan, then turn it out onto a wire cake rack. Cool
  completely before serving. Serves 12. Source: An Edible Christmas"

      Title: Almond Rocca
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Pecans, chopped (we use
           -chopped almonds on some
           -batches)
    3/4 c  Brown sugar (packed)
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine (butter
           -makes it richer)
    1/2 pk (6 oz size) semisweet
           -chocolate chips. (1/2 cup)
 
  Almond Rocca: This is not for Almond Roca, yet it is close enough and
  it is real easy. In fact my 14 year old daughter has been making it
  by herself at christmas for the past 4 years. Hope this will meet
  your needs. It comes from the Betty Crocker cookbook, so you may have
  it on hand already.
  
  Toffee: Butter square pan, 9x9x2 inches. Spread chopped nuts in pan.
  Heat sugar and butter to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil over
  medium heat, stirring constantly, 7 minutes (watch it real close the
  last minute or two).  Immediately spread mixture evenly over nuts in
  pan. Sprinkle chocolate pieces over hot mixture; place a baking sheet
  over pan so contained heat will melt chocolate.  Spread melted
  chocolate over canndy. While hot, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares.  chill
  until firm.
  
  Now for the changes we use.
  
  When we are going to be giving this as a gift, we melt another 1/2
  cup of chocolate in the microwave.  Use an 7x7x2 pan (or smaller than
  the 9x9x2). Spread the melted chocolate on top of the buttered pan
  that is covered with the nuts.  After the chocolate is spread on top,
  sprinkle more nuts on top, while chocolate is still warm. Then cut
  into small sizes. After the candy is set, remove from the pan and
  wrap individually with desert foil. I get mine at the bakery supply,
  or a craft shop.

      Title: Hard Candy
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
MMMMM----------------STIR TOGETHER BEFORE HEATING---------------------
      2 c  Cane sugar
    2/3 c  Light Karo
    3/4 c  Water
      1 ts Oil flavor* & color
      1 ts Or more citric acid**
 
  Have color/flavor/citric acid ready when finished cooking! *More or
  less, some flavors are stronger than others. **Put citric acid in
  fruit-flavored candies for tartness. TEST YOUR THERMOMETER EVERY DAY!
  To test: Place it in cold water & bring to boil. If water boils at-
  say 210 instead of 212, reduce cooking time 2 degrees. ***I use a
  TAYLOR thermometer. Wilton sells them now. Spray *PAM in molds & on
  surface. Not too much & only once per session. USE A THIN PAN, NOT
  HEAVY! Candy must set a few minutes in the pan & the temp will rise,
  burning the candy in a thick pan. Bring mixture to boil. Put lid on
  for 3 minutes <to wash down sugar crystals>, add thermometer & DON'T
  STIR. When therm. reaches 285-290D. remove pot from stove.Wait for
  temp. to lower below 260^ before adding color/flavor/citric acid.
  <Will cook flavor out if too hot.> Cover pan after adding citric acid
  so it won't fade the taste. I add about 2 ts citric acid.
        DON'T STIR!  Use the tiny viles of Lorann oils. Avail. in cake
  supply shop or drug store.
   I pour the cooked candy into a GUTTMAN candy funnel <holds entire
  recipe.> Thats the quickest way to get it in molds befor it cools &
  hardens. *Of course, spray funnel! I pour some into molds & the rest
  onto my marble slab. The part on the slab: I roll it into a long
  cylinder & cut into "pillows" w/scissors. Dust finished candies with
  powdered sugar so they won't "melt" together. There is one very nice
  sucker mold. It is a white ring w/ a slit for the stick. <Don't spray
  stick.> All you do is spray mold, add stick, fill w/candy, cool &
  remove easily Comes in 2-3 sizes, round or heart-shaped. I beleive it
  is Guttman Brand & available here at Sugarcraft. About 2 dz in a
  pack. This is my kids favorite Christmas candy. You will want to make
  several flavors. Experiment on how-much flavor. All vary. *Don't add
  too much on the mints. Takes more on the
  cherry/strawberry/lemon/orange, etc. There are at least 50 oil
  flavors available to choose from! Shared by Dolores McCann, Hamilton

    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Light corn syrup
    1/2 ts Peppermint extract
      3    Drops green food color
           Sugar or coarse sugar
 
  For best results, follow the directions carefully to avoid
  undercooking the mixtures.  No candy thermometer is necessary for
  this old-fashioned candy shop candy.
  
  Line 8 inch square pan with foil, butter foil.  In small saucepan,
  combine water and pectin.  Stir in baking soda.  In medium saucepan,
  combine 1 cup sugar and corn syrup.  Cook both mixtures over high
  heat until foam starts to disappear on pectin mixture and sugar
  mixture comes to full rolling boil (one that cannot be stirred down),
  about 3 to 5 minutes,stirring both constantly. Slowly pour pectin
  mixture into sugar mixture, stirring constantly.  Continue to boil
  for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat; stir in
  peppermint extract and food color. Pour into foil-lined pan.  Cool
  until firm.
  
  Remove candy from pan by lifting foil.  With wet knife or
  scissors,cut into small pieces or desired shapes.  Roll in sugar.
  Store loosely covered.

      Title: Stained Glass Candy
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  3 3/4 c  White sugar
  1 1/2 c  Lily white syrup (or Karo,
           -must be colorless)
      1 c  Water
           Food coloring
           Oil based flavorings such as
           - Wiltons
           Tin foil
           Icing sugar, approximately
           - 10 cups, can be reused
           - over and over
           Sharp pair of scisors
           Candy thermometer
           Lots of volunteers to help
 
  Mix the white sugar, white syrup, and water in a medium sized pot.
  Add the food coloring you want (green for spearmint, orange for
  orange) Bring to a boil, and boil until candy thermometer reaches 300
  F degrees. (Can take up to 20 minutes)   Stir to mix all the
  ingredients, but once it starts to boil, do not touch.  Pot must be
  big enough to allow for double, as it rises as it boils
  
  While the candy mixture is boiling, shape a large piece of tin foil by
  folding up the sides and ends.  (I use the large foil about 3 feet
  long) to create a large cookie sheet type shape.  Put the icing sugar
  on the foil to completely cover it, and bank up the sides with icing
  sugar.
  
  When the candy mixture has reached 300F, remove from heat.  Let sit
  about 10 seconds and stir to cool slightly (heavy emphasis on
  SLIGHTLY) Then add about 1 to 1-1/2 tsp of the oil based flavorings
  depending on how strong you want the flavor.  Stir until mixed (may
  boil a bit and DON'T stand over top of pot as flavor with escape in
  the air and up your nose!! 8-} ) Once flavoring is combined, pour
  mixture onto the icing sugar and use rubber spatula to scrape all
  mixture out of pot.  Put pot, spatula and candy thermometer into
  sinkful of hot soapy water.  If you allow it to harden you won't be
  saying nice things about me at all!! 8-} As candy is cooling, keep
  checking by trying to pull up the edges.  Once it gets to the
  consistency that you can lift it a little, start cutting it FAST! I
  cut off a chunk and then cut it up into bite-sized pieces. The
  outside will cool first so you have to watch it.  If it hardens to
  quickly you will end up with a good size lollipop that you won't be
  able to cut. It will shatter like glass. Continue working your way
  around until all is cut. Then I take all the candy and put it in a
  strainer that is sitting over a bowl. Shake some of the excess icing
  sugar off candy and allow to cool thoroughly. Pack in airtight
  containers. I find Zip-Loc Freezer bags pretty good. This recipe
  makes about 2 lbs candy. Once I have done all the flavors that I
  want, then I set up all the bags and put about 10 of each flavor into
  a smaller zip-loc and seal.  They make great Christmas gifts for
  family and all the various people you give to....mailman, garbage
  man, paperboy, school teachers, your kids friends..etc.  I figure if
  the kids have to help me cut, they get some to give to their
  friends..  Besides.. makes a good bribe to get them to help!!

    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
    1/2 c  Mayonnaise
 
  I too like Mustard Sauce, and have enjoyed making it for many years.
  Recently, I came upon this recipe in the Pillsbury Spring Celebrations
  classics 27, 1983. It's great with won tons, and on sandwiches. In
  small saucepan, combine dry mustard, sugar, salt, vinegar and egg.
  Cook over low heat 2 to 3 minutes until thickened, stirring
  constantly. Chill 10 to 15 minutes; stir in mayonnaise.
    Refrigerate leftovers 3/4 cup. This recipe has more flavor than the
  others. If you use any recipes that taste bland, including restaurant
  offerings, I usually touch them up with a slight amount of sugar and
  salt.  Dry Mustard, which I purchase by the pound, vinegar and water
  has very little flavor. Hope this helps. Merry Christmas and May God

  water for at least 1/2 hour. Remove from the water, squeeze dry and
  chop. 2. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan or flameproof casserole, heat
  the olive oil over moderate heat. Add the carrot, onion and celery
  and saute until the onion is golden, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic
  and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 3.  Add the sausage, ground
  beef and pancetta to the pan. Cook over moderate heat, stirring to
  break up the meat, until the beef and sausage are no longer pink.
   Drain off any fat. Season with the salt, pepper and nutmeg. 4. Pour
  in the red wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until it evaporates,
  about 5 minutes.
   Add the tomato paste, tomatoes, porcini and 1/2 cup of warm water.
  Simmer for 30 minutes.  If the sauce gets too thick, add a little
  more water. (The recipe
  
  can be made to this point up to 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate;
  reheat before serving.)  Add the parsley just before serving. FROM:

      Title: BARBECUED BUTTERFLIED LEG OF LAMB WITH MINT AND POCKET BR
 Categories: Meats, Holiday
      Yield: 9 servings
 
      1    Leg of lamb (5-6 lb)*
    3/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
    1/3 c  Mint jelly
    1/3 c  Minced fresh mint leaves
           Fresh mint sprigs (opt)
           Salt
           Pepper
           Small pocket bread**
 
  * - boned and trimmed of surface fat
  ** - or regular pocket bread, cut in half crosswise
  ======================================================================
  ===
  1. Lay meat boned side up. Slash about halfway through thickest
  portions, as needed, and pull meat, patting cut edges down, to make
  the piece relatively even.
  2. Place lamb in a 9x13" pan. In a 1 1/2 quart pan over medium-high
  heat, stir vinegar with 1/3 cup mint jelly just until boiling. Stir
  in mint and pour evenly over lamb. Cover and chill 2 hours or up to a
  day. Turn meat over occasionally.
  3. On firegrate in a barbecue, with a lid, ignite 50-60 charcoal
  briquets. When briquets are dotted with ash, in about 30 minutes,
  spread them into a single layer; scatter 10-12 more briquets over
  coals. Set grill 5-6" above coals. Lift meat onto grill; reserve
  marinade. Put lid on barbecue and open vents.
  4.Turn meat as needed to brown evenly; baste with marinade. Cook until
  thickest part of meat is done to your liking; for rare (140' on a
  thermometer) in center of thickest part, allow about 40 minutes total.
  Thinner sections will be well done.
  5. Transfer lamb to a platter and let rest 5-10 minutes. Garnish with
  mint sprigs. Slice meat thin. Season to taste with mint jelly, salt,
  and pepper. Eat with knife and fork or tuck into pocket bread.

      Title: Apricot-Raisin Jam
 Categories: Apricot, Jam, Gift
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried apricot halves,
           -coarsely chopped
      1 c  Golden raisins
           Juice and grated rind of 1
           -lemon
      1 c  Orange juice
      2 c  Sugar
 
  I received a great little book for Christmas called "From My House To
  Yours" that has gift recipes, ideas and lots of little tid-bits. The
  following recipe is from that book.  I'll include the notes the author
  wrote and will follow this message with the recipe for English Muffin
  Loaf that he makes note of. Sonya
  
  "This is delicious with toasted thin slices of English Muffin Loaf.
  Dried apricots sold in bulk are usually more flavorful than the
  prepackaged kind; natural food stores are a good source."
  
  1. Place the apricots and raisins in a bowl and add water to cover.
  Cover the bowl tightly and let it stand overnight. Drain the liquid
  into a large, heavy saucepan and chop the apricots coarsely. Add the
  apricots, raisins, lemon juice and rind, and orange juice to the pan,
  place over low heat, and bring to a simmer. Cook 20 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  2. Add the sugar and continue cooking, stirring frequently until the
  mixture of fruit is very soft and the syrup sheets when dropped from
  the side of a spoon (220 degrees on a candy thermometer), 15 to 20
  minutes. Spoon the jam into sterilized half-pint jars. Seal the jars,
  process in a boiling-water bath for 10 minutes and cool. Store in a
  cool, dark place.

      Title: Leftover Turkey Or Chicken Hash

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 tb Butter; melted or chicken
           -fat (up to 3T)
      1    Onion; thinly sliced
    1/2 c  Celery; diced
      2 c  Turkey; cooked,diced
           -(up to 3 cups)

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 tb Turkey or chicken fat
           -(I would use butter)
      3 tb Flour
  2 1/2 c  -Water
    1/2 ts Savory
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Cream

MMMMM------------------------HOT BISCUITS-----------------------------
      2 c  Flour; all purpose
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Cream
      2    Eggs; beaten
 
  La fricasee fatuguee
  
  Heat in frying pan 2-3 Tbsp melted butter or turkey or chicken fat.
  Add thinly sliced onion and diced celery. Heat 5-8 minutes over low
  heat, stirriing often. Add 2-3 cups cooked turkey. Cook 5 minutes
  over low heat.
  
  Sauce: Brown the chicken fat (I would use butter) and flour well
  before adding water. Add savory, salt and pepper to taste. When sauce
  is smooth and creamy, add 1/4 cup cream and any remaining turkey or
  chicken gravy. Pour over turkey. Simmer 15 minutes, then serve with
  hot biscuits and pickled beets.
  
  Hot Biscuits: Sift together in bowl, flour, baking powder (no error in
  amount) and salt. Mix together cream with 2 beaten eggs. Add to flour
  and mix just enough to moisten; the dough is rather soft and should
  remain lumpy. Stir as little as possible. Drop by spoonfuls on a
  greased cookie sheet. Cook 16 minutes at 400F.
  
  from Mme. Benoit, "In days that followed Christmas, every bit of the
  turkey was used - the bones for soup, the skin, diced and crisped in
  the oven til browned, then served, instead of butter, on toasted
  homemade bread. So, when it came time to make hash from all the
  little bits and pieces, the children felt that the poor turkey must
  be tired (fatiguee), hence the name.
